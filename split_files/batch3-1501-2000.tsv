The trail is marked with 2 large lion statues. If you walk this trail there is said to be a slave house where the white settlers had dropped off the slaves when they came in from the river. The rumor behind this is that in the 1980's 4 kids went in to look 4 ghosts and they never came back, so 2 cops were sent in to look 4 them and only one came back out, the other was never seen again. Also sometimes you will see the lion statues eyes reflect light like if they were glass, but there cement. This whole area is said to be haunted.

Hauppauge	United States	The Begjaines (long dead) Have haunted this old house for over 215 years. It all started in 1778 when Mr. Begjaine was killed at fort Ticonderoga. Mrs. Begjaine moved her three kids to a mansion in Hauppauge. Shortly after the move a man with an English accent came to the front door saying he wanted to sell some hats. When Mrs. Begjaine let him in he pulled out a gun and killed the whole family. To this day the cops are still investigating the crime. Neighbors complain of strange noises and gunshots coming from the old abandoned house at night. Most of the cops go in but few have lived to come out.

Lockport	United States	There is an old house across from a bar in Lockport. It was a house that was involved in keeping slaves during the Civil War and was part of the underground railroad. There was a massacre there, where everyone was killed. A few years ago someone bought it to restore and make into a museum but the men rebuilding it kept getting very scared by ghostly presences on the site and in the house. They left their scaffolding there and never came back. If you go near the house at night you can see black figures guarding it.

Long Island	United States	Back in 1997, there was an off-duty FDNY firefighter running track on a highschool track near his house. There were some kids who had a gun and they wanted to see what it felt like to shoot someone, so they waited in the woods until the fireman came around the northeast corner of the track, then they shot him. Both boys were arrested and convicted for killing the firefighter. Not long after, people reported seeing a glowing figure running along the track. Others have seen the body of a man laying on the track then dissappearing, all in the same spot he was shot, the northeast corner of lane 5. Most people won't go over to the northeast bleachers because they have the feeling of being watched. When visiting football teams come to visit, they and their fans refuse to sit in the visitors bleachers, as those lie on the northeastern part of the field. That part has now become mostly abandoned.

Long Island	United States	Lake Ronkonkoma has a haunted past. One legend is about a Setauket Sachem Indian who was not permitted to marry his love from another tribe. He paddled his canoe out to the middle of the lake and committed suicide via a knife to his heart. His body was recovered in another lake in Connecticut. Another is of a young beautiful Indian Princess who was not permitted to marry her pale face lover and she canoed out on the lake and was found dead by him. He in turn got into the canoe and was swept away, never to be seen again. Apparently, there has been a reported drowning each and every year due to a curse placed upon the lake. The myth is that the lake is bottomless. It rises and lowers mysteriously and is rumored to have a secret underwater Connection that stems for miles. Some of the drowning victims as well as the princess are said to still haunt the lake and It's surrounding area.

Long Island	United States	Mary's Grave - She murdered her two children and her husband. Her gravesite is a center for strange happenings. Her marker has her birth date but no death date. - December 2003 Update: There is a different variation on that story that seems to be the most heard of around there. Supposedly Mary was the daughter of a rich land owner that owned that area and formed the town there. He was a loner and built his house way out from the town. He also had a son. She had no friends and her father built her a stone club house on the property for her to play. She liked animals and wuld play with them in her stone clubhouse. Supposedly she was possessed by a spirit and started mutilating the animals on a stone table in her clubhouse. Later on she killed her father and her brother with an axe. After the some time the townspeople went to see what had happened the the land owner and found her sleeping in her fathers bed with him covered in blood. They hung her on a tree on the property. The tree is there on the side of the road. It always looks dead all year long. The burn marks from her rope are on the tree branch. Up the hill is the house. You can see a figure sitting in the window looking down on the road. Now that part of the house is supposed to be blocked off. Her stone clubhouse is on the road just a bit further up. The way it went was back in the 60's and 70's you were the big tough guy if you went up to Mary's grave and urinated on it. They say whoever did would get into a car accident on the way back swerving to avoid hitting a girl in a white dress. The gravesite has been lost or nobody really remembers where it is, but all the other things are there.

Beloit	United States	In the backroom of the stage where all of the costumes are kept and sometimes students gather to discuss or do homework during free time there is said to be a man who used to live on that spot where McNeel was built who haunts it. One of the worst experiences was when the Theatre teacher Ms. Franze was sleeping on the couch and when she awoke there was blood everywhere and students soon pointed out that she had an electricity plug stuck into the back of her head. The ghost also writes in the mirror hanging on the wall and slams the door. There's a chalkboard in the room on which 666 will be scratched and no one will be able to erase it and then a few days later disappear and then reappear. It's very quiet back there and there's always a dark feeling like you're not supposed to be in there. Ceiling tiles also fall down but only if someone had been standing there just seconds before. This has happened on many occasions.

Boltonville	United States	"There is a section of Jay road which goes thru a swamp. The area is always very dark and ominous. In the winter months this part is closed due to flooding and ice. The history is that apparently a woman was jogging down Jay road at some early part of the morning. A drunk driver, either didn't see her or was unable to stop in time to avoid hitting her. (If you travel this length of the road you will see there is no shoulder.)Her body was knocked into the swamp. Whether the incident was reported to the police is still under debate, however her body was never recovered. Persons who have traveled ""Seven Bridges"" have reported seeing a haze appear just outside their headlights, when your vehicle ""catches up to"" the entity it appears as a figure of a woman in a jogging outfit. She will jog down the road in front of your vehicle for about fifty feet, before she turns to face you, and you literally ""hit"" her. Some have had her vanish on their hoods while others say they have seen her head appear in their vehicles and look at the driver before disappearing. Reports also say if you go down this same length during the day vehicles(which are stopped) may not start up after being shut down. And that she is trying to stop people so that her body may be put to it's ""proper rest"".

Boulder Junction	United States	Stevenson Creek is located far in the woods in which you can walk or bike to. All that is left of the building that once stood is a 40 ft stone chimney and the cement walls of the basement. The building that once stood in the 1920's was three stories high and was used as a bed and breakfast. One day, everybody who had been staying there, even the owners, disappeared and the house was abandoned. Nobody knows what happened to the people staying in that house. People who have paid a visit to this place have said that you can still see people walking into the basement, kids playing by the creek, sometimes running in the tall grass, and windy spots around people when everything else is calm.

There is a large field(about the size of a football field) that is owned by the cemetary. At the end of the field, there is a wooded area. To the left, it appears to be a large path/clearing. That is where the private cemetary is. It's very shady, fenced in, and surrounded by houses. There are a handful of old graves, scattered about, so if venturing there in the dark, be careful not to trip and fall. The cemetary is closed from Sunset to Sunrise.

Malone	United States	Was built on a cemetery. The cemetery was also built on Indian Sacred ground. There have been sightings of Indians on the playground, and a man who actually uses the boy's bathroom. My Aunt lives behind the school and found out that not only is the school on Indian Sacred ground, but also their house is on the actual burial ground. My three cousins woke up at exactly the same time one night and saw an Indian girl standing on the deck. Also, they have heard moans from the basement. A few years after these occurrences, they put in a pool. They found human bones and Indian artifacts. Since that point, nothing has occurred at the house.

Monroe	United States	The McGarrah Stagecoach Tavern Inn (Monroe, NY) was on Ghost Hunter (SCI-FI) program, and in Ghost Investigator Volume 6 (Dark Shadows) book by Linda Zimmermann and has had many ghosts sighting. The McGarrah Stagecoach Tavern Inn began its existence sometime between 1790 and 1800 and constitutes one of the oldest buildings in Monroe, N.Y. On of the common sightings is a man with top hat, dress in a dark suit wondering the rooms upstairs. A witness attempted to confront the ghost by running after him, but as he turned the corner, the ghostly man vanished. The man is described about 5ft, dress in a dark suit style in 1800 with top hot. You could hear his footstep as he walks back and forth on the second floor. The basement is truly a frightening experience. Every time we went down stars the temperature dropped at least 15 degrees.

All of a sudden he said it felt and sounded like someone had either jumped on the back of the car or pushed down on it. Then again on top of the car.

Newburgh	United States	"The story goes... There is a rather large building, in which is now know Plum Point condo's, in Newburgh NY that used to be a all boys Christian school. One of the nun's molested the boy & killed him then put his body in the wall and covered it up well (being there was already construction going on inside it was a good cover-up, he was just reported missing) Then about a year later strange things would happen that drove the school to shut down. For about 10 or more years now they have been trying to make it into an apartment complex because there are condo's all around it, and every time someone goes in there to work, a hand was cut off by machinery, the machinery would break for no apparent reason, etc.. And many people have said they have seen the boy. - October 2005 Correction: The above submission is the ""popular word about town"" regarding the information on our site, however, most of it is not true. Unfortunately, this same description regarding Plum Point on many websites. Probably cutting and pasting from this site. A visitor to our site reports the following: ""Before the condos went in, there was a large mansion (complete with detached servant's quarters.) It was originally constructed for a family who met an untimely death. The mansion then became a home for wayward girls for many years and eventually an orphanage of sorts, accepting children who were not only parentless, but had no where to run. This is where the rumors of the molestation occurrence sprouts from. The molestation may be true, but in all my research and hearing of rumors, I have never heard a report of anyone being buried in the walls."

Newfane	United States	A man named James Van Horn built this mansion in 1820. His wife died at the age of 21, some say under mysterious circumstances. A roofer almost fell to the ground after he saw a woman looking at him out of a window of the empty house. Carpenters fled when a person materialized out of a cloud in a bedroom. They wouldn't go back even to get their tools. Some motorists have tried to avoid a girl running from the mansion, then vanished.

New Hartford	United States	The school was built on an Indian burial ground. There have been sightings by one of the janiors that used to work in the school. She cleaned the auditorium routinely and often found one of the side doors locked, when it wasn't supposed to be. When she returned with the key, the door was shut and locked. One time she felt something like a person pass through here, and very soon after quit her job because of how much it frightened her.

Chilton	United States	since opening in september of 1996, 3rd shift workers have reported unexplained phenomenon. Merchandise flying off the shelves, stereos turning on or changing channels by themselves, trails of muddy footprints that appear on clean floors, to numerous unexplained electrical problems with the security system mainly reporting movement when the store was totally empty of people. There have been reports of cold spots, mysterious mists or fogs in the building, and many cases of workers feeling that someone was standing behind them and even seeing shadows behind them and turning and no one is there. There have been a few sightings of a black human form seen walking through the store, sometimes right through displays. The store was built on an old homestead that had on it a family cemetary. They moved the bodies when they built the store, but they say that some of the older graves were unmarked and that they missed some of them, thus the haunting of the store by restless spirits.

Cornell	United States	"The small city library in Cornell is a location that triggers unease in most any one that enters it. As far as the history of the building, the basement, where the restroom is, used to be a jail during the earlier duration of Cornell's existace. The entire building has a heavy sort of a feeling to it, but it is the basement in particular that makes all who step down there to visit the restroom uneasy. Some librarians working there would not go down to the basement to the restroom the entire time they worked there because of the uncomfortable feeling that overwhelms visitors to the basement.

Delafield	United States	Nashotah House & Seminary - The grounds of this Episcopal seminary have been inhabited since the 1500s, and have been inhabited by a ghost since the mid-1700s. When an acolyte to the Episcopal priesthood attended this seminary, his wife had an affair with the Dean. To accommodate this affair, the woman hanged her husband; it was ruled a suicide, however. Since committing suicide is a mortal sin, the acolyte was buried in a cornfield rather than the cemetery. On her deathbed, the cheating wife confessed to her crime. The seminary wished to rightfully bury the body, so they exhumed the casket only to find that it was empty. It is said that the acolyte still haunts the grounds trying to get justice.

New York City	United States	"Numerous reports since the 1920s of students seen -- and recognized by students, and [former] professors years back -- known to have died in the First World War, haunting one of the former political club lounges in Shepherd Hall. Legend had it that in one particular instance, a math tutor noticed that a student's clothes seemed somewhat dated for the mid-20s and put it in his mind to inquire as to how the young man was making out financially; given it was still a wholly free college with a mostly working class student body. Only later that night did this ""absent minded professor"" wake up from sleep with a start, scaring his wife in the process [isn't that always the case?], with the recollection that the young man died in France in 1918.

Niagara Falls	United States	Devils hole - Down by devils hole, just underneath the famous hauntings of Clet Castle, Niagara University, there are mysterious apparitions, foreign language cants, and sometimes the feeling that someone is watching you or simply just brushed you gently as they passed you by. The light never really does seem to shine fully on this long decent of stairs. and many locals will not go down there at night, not because of crime, because people here are very trusting.

People have reported seeing a nun roam the halls along with strange noises and lights going on and off in locked upped rooms. Urban legend of a nun hanging herself is untrue. No one is sure where the little boy fits in. - ”There is, however, something definitely not right in the upper floor in the new dormitory wing. There has been cold spots in one room, strange appearances and a feeling of ""evil"" in one or two rooms. A couple of the sisters have experienced this as well as the lay students and the dormitory wing was blessed by a priest exorcist. According to the girls, problems all began with students playing around with an ouija board.

Genoa	United States	At night the current owner of the restaurant turns off the lights, but on some nights after she leaves and locks up, the lights turn back on. People have heard footsteps from the basement stairs, and dishes have mysteriously disappeared. The man who they assume is the spirit of the ghost used to be the owner of the restaurant, and he used to drink 8 cups of coffee a day. That is the number of cups that have been missing. He also used to watch CNN all the time, and no one was allowed to change the station on the television.

Oswego	United States	Rt. 104 and Klocks Corners Intersection - Many people have lost their lives trying to pull out of a very dangerous intersection, that has a big hill coming from one direction and is only a 2 way stop. The speed limit is 45 but many go past that. Multiple car crashes and pedestrians have been killed at the intersection since it was constructed. A graveyard diagonal to the intersection has been seen to have ghosts what walk around, up and down the street, and sometimes in the middle of the road. Most appear in light shades of grey. They are of different sex and age, and always seem to be looking back and forth in all directions of the road, as to be looking out of traffic.

Ozone Park	United States	The Jewish cemetery is over a century old, and has hardly been taken care of. Though many have passed it on the A train, at Boyd ave. It has ben vandalized so often that the caretakers are forced to close it down at 4 PM. The graveyard is a group of 3 cemeteries. If you walk in it you will come across many graves with pictures of who occupies the tomb. As well as a few un-earth graves. One part is almost sectioned off, where only infants and children remain, with there tombstones almost completely sucked into the ground. The trees for some reason also grow in twisted formations that even you imagination can't muster a image. At night you feel like you are being watched. Reports of cries, talking, laugher and an ominous fog loom over the site. As well as faces and orbs appearing in pictures. And sites of gray images sitting on the tomb stones. But who says its safe during the day? At all hours you feel you are being watched. As well as many who have reported stomach pains near the location. While you walk, you feel like something is standing next to you or running past your eyes. And once in a while you get an over whelming stench, that brings tears to you eyes. Prey you don't go and vandalize the already damaged graves, who knows how much more those poor souls can take.

Oyster Bay	United States	The home was originally owned by the Townsend family. The house was used as a base for the British during the Revolutionary War. John Andre was a British Major during the war and visited often. One day Townsend's daughter overheard Andre and John Simcoe (Commander of British Forces) talking about a payment to Benedict Arnold to surrender his troops. The Townsends relayed this information to George Washington. Benedict Arnold escaped, but Andre was captured and hanged. His ghost was first reported here in the 1930s when he was seen on horseback outside a bedroom window. John Andre isn't the only ghost here. Sally Townsend, allegedly John Simcoe's lover is said to still haunt the house. Her former bedroom is always cold, even in the summer the curator wears a warm wool vest in that room! Paranormal investigators have said that whatever is in that room is not happy. In October of 1999 a volunteer was working on the property when the garden door opened and a man came out wearing a dark wool coat with brass buttons. First it was strange to see someone wearing that clothing, second the building was locked, and third the alarms were all on! In march another worker saw the same ghost materialize by the staircase. Once with the bottom half of his body missing, and then again full-figure. The ghost is believed to be Michael Conlin, an Irish immigrant who worked as a servant in the 1860's. In the upstairs of the former servants quarters moving shadows have been seen when no one else is in the house. In that same area the smell of roses has mysteriously been sensed. The spirit of a servant woman has materialized and walked into the kitchen. In that kitchen the smell of apple pie has also been present when ghosts want to make themselves known. The submitter was extremely privileged when they smelled the strong scent of cinnamon-apple on their way down the stairs near the kitchen. When they got down to the bottom of the stairs they could smell the strong scent of something like cinnamon rolls or apple pie! Another area that is said to produce some interesting smells is the front foyer. The smell of a non-existent stove has been sensed there as well as the faint smell of a smoking pipe. At one time this was the kitchen area. The former museum director Andrew Batten says he has sensed at least 5 different entities and something in Sally Townsend's room.

Ozone Park	United States	St. Anthony's Hospital - Update: Has since been torn down. - Close down in the late 1960's to early 70's this abandoned seven story building with a smokestack on the left hand side of the building, and a steel spiked fence around the perimeter of the hospital. The hospital was used for severely ill patients. At night only the first two floors were lighted up. Above the second floor is a whole different story. No Trespassing above the second floor. But you could hear noises and slamming sounds coming from the stairway that leads to the third floor and the fourth floor. I'm not to sure what it is today but it still stands today.

Janesville	United States	Reports of a lady in White & many white figments float through the air. - June 2008 Investigation: The reports of a woman in white is easily dismissed because of the very lifelike statue that is illuminated by lights all around it. It's very scary, but definitely not a ghost. Also, the white lights throughout the cemetery are markers so that people don’t trip at night. Regardless, they are just lights. Also, people leave the covered candles by graves and create the same effect, only creepier, as they flicker in the wind sometimes. No paranormal activity.

They shrugged it off thinking he was a guest enjoying a cigar in the lower level. Bidding him a ""Good Evening"" , He was just staring there blankly at the wall with his right leg bent against the wall behind him and both hands thrust into his pockets. He just stared so blankly at the floor as though he didn't just see the witness greeting him. Well to get back to the office ,they had to pass him . After they passed him they got a really uneasy feeling... turned around and he was gone. Feeling a little stirred, they called security . And on the playback camera.

Port Chester	United States	Late in the 1940's, senior students at the High School tortured and dragged a freshman to the clock tower as a freshman prank. Upon reaching the top of the old staircase, the young boy fell from the clock tower and landed on the concrete below. He broke his neck and died instantly. The boys responsible for the crime never confessed until they started experiencing hauntings during school. One was haunted so bad that he committed suicide a year later. The boy's ghost still haunts the clock tower today and can be seen opening the door that leads to it. Students also report that the lights flicker upon opening the door.

Poughkeepsie	United States	The ghost of former Rector, Dr. Alexander Griswold Cummings has been reported here many times since his death in the late 1940s or early 50s. While he was still living, he did not like using candles, so candles used during services were repeatedly blown out. At one point, a bat materialized in the church, then disappeared. In the 1970s, Bishop James Pike, Rector at the time, scared the ghost away from the sanctuary by bringing his dog into the church. After that, Alexander remained quiet for a while. In the 1990s, Alexander surfaced again. This time, it was because current Rector, the Rev. Michael Phillips, decided to move the Rector's office to a different location in the building. The move outraged the ghost, and for years afterwards, the old rector's office (now the library) would be freezing cold in the mornings, even during the spring. Eventually, the ghost went back into hiding. Another ghost is the spirit of an elderly lady, who died in the middle of a service sometime in the 1910s. Her ghost has been seen sitting in a pew halfway back, and many who sit halfway back in darkness in the evening and night feel a strange presence, even if there appears to be nothing there.

Queens	United States	Fort Totten - 150-year-old military base also an old Indian burial ground (under soccer field). Many areas are haunted. In mid-May '00, one guard was dozing in his patrol car at night when he heard a knock on the window. He opened his eyes to see 2 men, one on either side of the car, pointing at him & laughing.

Its a three story hotel, all but abandoned, you can't get to the third floor anymore because of holes in the stairway. Third floor has reported to have cold hands applying pressure to their back. If you flash your light at a second floor window they flash back at you. In the basement, feelings of being threatened. The name ""Hotel Hell"" came from the blood on the walls and the yelling from the basement, the ring of the bell and the sound of wheels. The smell of sewer gas is still there in the bathrooms. Old books were in one of the rooms upstairs, burst into flames.- January 2004 update/correction - these caves are right below hotel hell. you will hear moaning as of creatures or monsters there. Witnesses have heard laughing, have seen a little girl in a black dress wearing no shoes on the stairs which go into the caves area. you can hear singing there day or night. near the old stables, visitors have been chased by white light which some of them have seen as a carriage drawn by white horses. also in the old stables the sounds of horses hooves have been heard. The submitter of the update has done some research into hotel hell and it may never have been owned by Al Capone. the first thing to be built there was a ""resort"" built in the 1800's which was one of those places where people went to be cleansed by the natural spring water which still runs pure and clear there today. when you walk the trails there (it's still open to the public) there is one cave door which has been partially opened due to a rockslide, spring water still runs there."

Mequon	United States	When Concordia moved from downtown Milwaukee to its current location in Mequon (sold to them by the nuns who had lived here), it is said that a Sister named Sister Sixtoes was unwilling to move. She ended up dying near what is the chapel today. She still haunts the chapel as well as the dorms of Coburg, Catherine, and Augsburg. Students have reported sightings of an outline of a ghostly figure when walking down the stairs near the chapel late at night. Students have also reported things being moved in their rooms as well as lights, radios, TV’s, etc. Being turned on and off when no one else was around. Many strange things have occurred over the years that students have sworn was done by good ol' Sister Sixtoes.

Merrill	United States	In the 1850's white lumbermen were welcomed by the Indians and their chief. Some time later his daughter Jenny, for whom the settlement was named for died. On how she died is speculation. One account says she fell in love with one of the lumberman, became pregnant and killed herself. Another is, she died during child birth. Another is she died from flu brought by the white man. The chief buried her on the hill, and cursed the ground that it would never do any white man any good. The curse is the legend. Nine people died after T.B. Scott bought the land for a home in 1884 and died unexpectedly in 1886 before the house was finished. Within a year his wife Ann died. Their son Walter went to see the architect to finish the house. He was stabbed to death by him. In 1893 it was sold to a man named Kuechle. He lost all his money on a gold mine and mortgaged the house to Tony Barsanti. Tony foreclosed and Kuechle went insane and died in an asylum. The same year Barsanti was stabbed to death in Chicago while waiting for a train to Merrill. In 1901, George Gibson bought the house and went to inspect it. He was never seen again. In 1906, Mary Fellhaber bought the property. Soon after fell ill and died. Popcorn Dan was the caretaker and died in 1912 after booking passage on the Titanic.The next caretaker Mr. Lloydsen died of alcoholism. In 1919 the widower of M. Fellhaber gave the property to the city. In 1923 the city gave it to the Sisters of the Holy Cross who have seemed to break the curse for now. Rumors of ghost sightings in the tower.

Milton	United States	In rooms 145-148 there are two ghostly figures of old teachers that are seen. They died when the school caught fire in the 60's. If you sit in any desks one of the women will walk past you and give you an evil look. You’ll feel very disoriented and uncomfortable. If you look at the chalkboard you'll see that the names of all the children these two punished are writing there. You can't erase them. Also, if you were to sit in the Auditorium that was just built, you will hear the curtains open slightly and then fall to the floor.

Milwaukee	United States	If you drive past Bell Middle School , you might see on the lawn of the school, a man walking with a black book bag. Whenever a car passes by and if the man hears the car, he'll stop, look on the side and down to the grass. Then, he'll continue walking. To recognize him, look for his dark black shirt, and his dark blue jeans. He has no shoes, or feet, just legs. He's totally bald and comes out after 9:00 usually. If you're lucky, he might be walking on the playground and he'll look up, then continue walking. One more thing - good luck finding him and report back if you spot him!

Milwaukee	United States	Eagles Club - This building built in the late 20's was an all male athletic club. Many areas of the building are very cold even in the heat of summer. The ballroom has access to a door that leads to the dome maintenance room which also leads to the roof has many times been investigated by security after reports of someone throwing things off the roof. When investigated no one is found, when things like empty beer cups and ashtrays have been found below. The basement floor which houses access to the pool viewing porthole and also the boiler room, has a dirt floor that security doing a sweep of the building at closing time, have felt the strong urge to leave by a presence and feeling of coldness that is overwhelming, also accompanied by a strong odor of starch or bleach smell. It is said that after it was closed and reopened as a shelter, a man that ran it was abusive and very intolerable, to the young men that stayed there. His negative energy is felt and reports of his apparition and coldness in the pool area and in the boiler room. As far as his apparition is concerned, they were reported by bar staff accompanying the security during sweeps, they were most likely under the influence of alcohol at the time. A strong sense of negative energy is felt in all parts of the building. Always felt at night when the building closes. Strange noise like shuffling feet and loud bangs can be heard while sweeping the building fro people who may hideout after a show. It may be heard in one area and when looked into the noises are heard in the area that was just secured. Unexplainable feeling of negative energy exists in the building. There is also the ghost of a little girl at the Rave. A worker who worked there for a year or so, spent time in the coat check area in the basement. There are catacomb like hallways that run behind the coat check area. One night during a concert, they heard a little girl laughing coming from the rear hallway. When they got up to look, a wind blew through the room, and a feeling of dread came over them, and in an instant it was over.

A strange man has been seen by staff and children in the church basement. Neighbors report that a former building on the site had a light that never went out even when the electricity was cut. Teachers also report feeling uneasy in the basement bathroom and hearing a strange “wooooooing” sound.

Schenectady	United States	Reports of the ghost of a young girl open an upstairs door, across from our classroom, and enter beyond it. She has short, wavy hair, was dressed in a brown flowered dress that went halfway down her shins, ankle socks, and old shoes. The door is always locked, and as students always assumed it was a closet. They told the teacher. She checked the door, and as it was still locked, she used the school secretaries key to check. The closet was actually a short set of stairs which led to a singular classroom which was no longer used and unknown to the current students. The girl was not found. My father, who attended the same school as a child, told me that the old room was used to teach retarded children in his and his own father's day. It was always locked even then to prevent the children from leaving. Many students as well as some teachers had seen spirit children open or go through the locked door to the classroom at the top of the hidden stairs.

It was called a suicide, but the water was only 4 feet deep at the deepest spot where this woman was found. There is also a graveyard that runs along side the edge of the gorge of this creek. There have been stories of a woman ,dressed in black garments of the 1800s alongside the creek,opposite the graveyard, looking right at a person, with a sad expression on her face, and then pointing across the gorge (towards the cemetary) and then disapearing. She has been seen in various areas of this property. In addition, General Sullivan was said to have marched through this area, burning down Native Americans crops along the way, and was said to have buried his cannowith all the soldiers pay somewhere, alongside the creek.

She is the spirit of the woman who lived in the home. Her husband had built the farmhouse when they were married, but he was called of in the civil war. When the husband returned home, he found his wife in bed with another man. He killed both of them and buried her on the property. The building has gone through a major renovation, but the basement was pretty much a dug out stone lined pit where there were many spirits. They were all either soldiers or slaves that would use the tunnels to hide in. There would be lights shattering for no reason, cold winds piercing your skin, and at one point The worker was actually thrown into a wall and the doors leading to an area in the basement that was cross nailed shut banged as if someone was running to hide in the dark.

Staten Island	United States	Richmond Town is located off of Amboy Road in Staten Island New York with a number of historical houses to visit. The houses range from 100-300 years old. All of the houses are known to have spirits in them. If you go there late at night, there is a specific house located on one of the side streets, which is white in color with a green cellar door on the side of the house. If you look up at the left hand window, you will without a doubt see the apparition of a little boy in the window. Two little boys were known to have died in the upper level of the house. You can go on a tour of Richmond Town during the day with the tour guides,(but it's more fun to explore at night). The up stairs in the children's house smells like a hospital, and the kitchen of the children's house still smells like the burning of the stove after a meal. If you go near the kitchen window at night, it smells like something was just cooked on the wood-burning stove. The schoolhouse in historical Richmond town is also haunted. There is also a small graveyard next to the old courthouse in Richmond Town, which has many restless spirits in it. One spirit is that of a young girl with a broken heart, who has been known to wander around at night looking for her lost love. When boys walk passed the graveyard or through Richmond Town, she sometimes mistakes them for being her long lost love.

Oshkosh	United States	"The art center is a house that was built during the depression. Her and her husband were extremely wealthy, and owned most of Oshkosh. They owned the larger factories, and paid their employees with, vouchers to purchase goods at stores the couple owned. Basically keeping all the money under their tight control. When the people of Oshkosh learned of the Paine center being built, they threatened the couple that if they ever moved into it, the people of Oshkosh would kill them. The couple feared the people of Oshkosh. And never did move it. In fact NO one has ever lived in the Paine Fine Art Center. Mr. Paine did pass on first, and Mrs. Paine did out live him. She donated their house to the city, with one stipulation, no children under 18 were allowed in it. She was never able to have children, and therefore resented children. Children are allowed in the center now, but Mrs. Paine is no longer alive. It's said that you can see the woman roaming the house during tours.

Once swayed, most of the girls are never seen again. He has no known residence, although it's said that he still lives in his parent's basement. If a confrontation happens then he runs like a lightning bolt, and isn't seen again. To everyone that has knowledge of him... he's a ghost!

Phillips	United States	alongside a highway in Phillips- Hwy 13, a jumbled crowd of over two hundred folk art figurines clog the landscape. It's a park that is eternally crowded with revelers, spirits and beer bottles -- if not beer -- abound. The public is invited to wander through this impressive sculptural display. This display is an eerie and strange place. As you walk threw you will experience many different feelings there are areas that make your hair stand on end on hot calm days you feel cold blasts of air that will give you goose bumps During nights of full moon its said you will see dark shapes of what have been said to look like demons dancing around the park A son of German immigrants, Fred Smith was born in 1886, and spent his working life as a north woodsman. With two other men, he built the Rock Garden Tavern in 1936, which he ultimately managed after his retirement from lumber jacking in 1949. In 1950 this self-taught sculptor began crafting his unique entourage of cowboys, miners, Indians, and soldiers. Indian. His first masterpiece was inspired by the image of a large antlered deer leaping over a log that he had noticed on a boy's sweater. He used beer bottles from his tavern to decorate the life-size concrete horde, which mostly crowds the front of the park along Hwy. 13. He built the broad-shouldered, blocky characters starting with wooden frames wrapped with mink wire, or animal skeletons.

Staten Island	United States	In Wolfe's pond park in prince's bay Staten island, if you enter the park through a path next to the prince's bay train station and follow the paths down you will come across a small 20 ft. cliff. At the bottom is a large pond. If you stand on the banks of the pond on a spot that has an upside down car in the water. At that spot in the 1970's a car with two teenagers inside mistakenly drove off that 20 ft drop and overturned. Their bodies were not found for two weeks. You are known to experience cold sensations or visions of a phantom car rolling and overturning in the lake. IN the 1970's and 80's several children were abducted, raped and murdered in these woods. Several people have reported hearing disembodied screams and crying, Some have even said they've seen little children walking on the path crying searching for their parents or possibly their killer.

Suffolk County	United States	Mary O'Leary's grave - Behind Queen of the Rosary Academy, there is a cemetery that priests and nuns were buried in.  A young novice had fallen in love with one of the grounds keepers.  She snuck out of the convent one night to meet her lover. They were going to run away and get married. Before her lover got there she was raped and murdered.  Because of the horrible way that she was murdered she could not be buried in the cemetery so they buried her where they found her body.  on the night of a full moon if you pulled up by her grave stone you could see her standing on the road side. They have since opened the road and her gravestone can no longer be found. However, when you drive a certain point of new highway, you can hear screams.

Syracuse	United States	On July 12, 1918, a munitions plant exploded at Split Rock Quarry, west of Syracuse. It took the lives of 50 men with it. 15 were never identified and buried in a common grave. More than 80 years after the plant blew up, the spirits of the dead still roam the ledges or stand on the ruined rock crusher of the old quarry. They glow in shades of green and yellow, a ghostly after-image of the effects of picric acid, the bitter, and toxic explosive that once stained miners' skin yellow-green. - August 2004 additional information: at split rock quarry in syracuse, new york it is said that there is a vortex by the munitions plant and you disappear for a half an hour and end up on the bottom of a hill...also the rock crusher that is there makes a humming noise like it is still running...in a tunnel that is behind the rock crusher there are stalagmites {i think thats what they are called} that actually still have blood on the end of them {it is supposedly blood but it looks like paint}...just thought you might like some extra information on things that happen there.

Saint Nazianz	United States	US headquarters for Catholic mystic cult which was forced to flee Germany in the 19th century because of its secret practices. Hotbed of pedophilia, closeted homosexual love triangles, suicide, fraud, incest and even an exorcism! The patron cult leader Father Oschwald is kept in a crypt on the grounds. His followers are buried in front of his crypt. Their graves are alternately sinking and rising. Oswald is known to wander the forested perimeter of the eutrophied Lake Oswald on a white horse. His followers wander the grounds moaning. The decayed buildings are known to be haunted by the screams of the tortured souls who've spent time there. In addition, they are infested with all manner of pests including many active wasp, hornet and bee hives. Much of the village was severely damaged in a freak storm in 2000. Locals uneasily murmur about the 'Wrath of Oswald' and his fury with the townsfolk who've abandoned him...

Spooner	United States	Railroad and newspaper man Frank Hammill is generally regarded as the ”Father of Spooner.” He arrived in 1883 on the Chicago Northwestern Railroad. He later became publisher of the Spooner Advocate, mayor of the town, and a prominent Republican politician. Hammill died suddenly in 1922 of a mysterious stomach problem. His body was displayed in the beautiful house he had built for himself and his family. His wife lived the remainder of her days there and often reported felling that Frank was still there with her. As time passed and new owners took over, the house gained a reputation of being haunted. Frank, said the owners, was still in “his” house, watching over “his” town. Most reported hearing noises, voices, and feeling that they simply were not alone in the old house -- one family even moved out. Today the apparent hauntings continue, and the current residents are absolutely certain they are not alone. They even refer to their “guest” as Frank.
