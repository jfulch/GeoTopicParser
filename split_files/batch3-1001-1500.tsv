Madisonville	United States	There is a statue of an Angel in the Grapevine Cemetery and it is said that her eyes turn red and bleed and she cries for all the dead babies.There are two different versions of the story to the angel of grapevine cemetery. One is that at midnight on a full moon she will look up at you and her eyes will leak blood. My friends mother said she saw that about twenty years ago, the story of my generation goes as all my friends grew up within minutes of the cemetery, that her head has been broken off and sits atop her body and her right wing is broken off and laying in the ground. It is said that if you knock of her head that she will curse you with bad luck and you might die, however if you place her wing on her then she will give you one wish. There is another story of a grave there, I don't know which one but that you pull up in front of it and roll down all your windows open your trunk and doors and turn a love song up loud, because some guy committed suicide after his girlfriend left him, the ghost of a young teenager will scream a death roar and you have to get the trunk closed along with the doors and roll up the windows before he gets to your car or you will die.

Marion	United States	"Many different things occur at this particular cemetery. It is located off of Baker Church Road going toward Morganfield. You turn to the left off Baker Church Road on to Baker Hollow Road. There is one cemetery behind the church on the left. After you pass this church there is a fork in the road, follow it to the left and this is where everything begins. However on a good night it begins when you first turn on the road. You have to go after dark but the best time to go is around or after midnight. This cemetery disappears and then reappears in different locations. However it will not show itself when you drive down the road. You have to drive down to the end of the road and turn around and come back in order to see the cemetery. You will know when you are close to the cemetery because you will have an overwhelming feeling of sadness and will begin to cry for no apparent reason. You will see and hear various things. Sometimes you can hear music playing, laughter, screams and hear things trying to get in your vehicle. There have also been fingerprints and dents in vehicles visitors have taken `ut there as well as scratches that came from the outside but went all the way thought the glass. If you are actually lucky enough to find the cemetery and drive up in to it you will not be able to drive out. It is so spiritually active that it drains the battery of your car leaving you stranded until the morning or until you get brave enough to push your car out. There have been images of Soldiers killing each other and those around them. There have been sightings of the dense woods opening where you can see more than you should. The fork in the road rolls and a dense mist appears and disappears as you drive the road. There is also a guardian dog. This dog closely resembles the ""Hounds of Hell"" as described in the Bible. This dog has dead yellow eyes and casts the shadow of a demon when it gets ready to disappear in the triangle at the fork in the road. The dog appears to be injured when it first appears on the side of the road, thus making you want to stop and pick it up, which in turn gives an open invitation to any spirit that is around. When you fail to pick up the dog things begin to change. The dog will walk a few steps and then turn to see if you are still following it. However if you speed up the dog will speed up, if you slow down it will slow down, if you go to the left it will go to the left, if you go to the right it will go to the right and it is impossible to run over this dog. There have also been sightings of wrecked vehicles with people screaming for help. Due to the period in time when this cemetery was began you will see images of men who were hung from the trees out this road before and after you pass the cemetery. You will also see images of dead family members calling to you. You will also experience a change in the weather when you turn out this road. For instance it will be raining before you turn on the road, but when you turn on to this road the rain mysteriously stops and the mist begins until you exit this road where the rain will start again. There are many other things that occur out this road but you have to be very alert and very open to the spirit world and you cannot show fear or it can take your soul, according to the legend. There are many trapped souls at this location that will mess with you. Make sure you do not have an open invitation of any kind. This means windows rolled up and doors locked. These spirits can also communicate with you through your dreams if you will let them. So go if you dare just don't show fear! Everyone sees something different when they go to this location so be prepared to be scared."

Marion	United States	"Witches Grave - This cemetery is located off of Ford's Ferry Road in Marion. The legend behind this cemetery is about a five year old girl who was burned at the stake, along with her mother, in the late 1800's to the early 1900's for witchcraft. It is not known what happened to the body of the mother, however the little girl, Mary Evelyn, is buried in a steel lined grave that is covered with rock and not dirt. She has a white picket fence surrounding her grave. The base of this fence is a series of crosses that connect end to end. However she is not tall enough to climb over the fence, unlike a normal 5 year old. Her tombstone looks brand new even though it is close to 100 years old, as does the fence. She paces inside this fence when someone comes to visit her making faces at them and reaching out to them. She sleeps during the day but is very evident at night. The legend also says that she can not rest because she is searching for her mother but can not escape the confines of the fence. Many unexplainable things occur at this cemetery. For one the ""Watcher"" makes himself very know and tries to follow you out of the cemetery. The ""Watcher"" was murdered at the swinging bridge but haunts the witch’s grave. He is trying to get to the little witch but because of the crosses that surround her he is unable to because he is evil. Crosses appear in the trees both upright and upside down, directly over her grave, though they face different directions. She presents herself as a normal 5-year-old little girl in a white dress, though her dress is scorched at the bottom as is her blonde hair. If you lay on her grave she will hold you down refusing to let go until someone from outside of the fence pulls you free. However never lay on the grave when you are alone because chances are you will be pulled into her grave to be with her thus giving her more power. As with every haunted cemetery people that are open to the spirit world sees something different."

The building is located just a few feet from the Robert Cleveland Log Home. The old jail is said to be haunted by many spirits.

Olive Hill	United States	Two things are rumored to happen there. One legend is never pass the old church on a Saturday night when it is drizzling. They say a woman is walking on the side of the road and if you pick her up she will disappear after a few miles. If you don't pick her up she will welcome herself into your backseat. The other one is to go to the church on Friday the 13th and look into the windows the locals say you will see the scariest thing in your life. Although no one has yet to describe what is in there nobody will go out to the church on Friday the 13th.

Owensboro	United States	In 1896 when the school was first built, it was made mostly of farmer's daughters because the boys never went to school. In 1899 the school was destroyed by a small tremor from the fault in Missouri. Two girls died when the school fell to the ground. In 1901 they rebuilt the school but over top of the old school (because it was so small) they built an art building. Still today the art building is haunted by the two girls who at night have been known to mess up the art room and when morning comes the room is a mess.

Owenton	United States	Here there is a pre civil war plantation that burnt down and killed 2 kids and there nanny. It was rebuilt and later turned into a private country club in 1967. The house was made into the restaurant and the rooms upstairs were rented out (to live in) then redone into a bed and breakfast (just for members guests). If you listen hard you can always hear little kids screaming and running footsteps all around. Doors won’t unlock and open or sometimes they won’t open even if unlocked. The nanny keeps quiet but every once in a while someone will get the privilege to see her full body in big windows that start at your nose. Since then the country club has been turned into a resort where they have built a hotel and made the golf course public. The ghosts do not like this, the fire alarms go off in the middle of the night for no reason and even after being reset will go off again. Curtains shut themselves and in the kitchen pots and pans will bang together and the doors will shut and lock themselves. The lights have dimmers and at night employees have said after turning off the switch and the lights on high they will come in the next morning and the lights will be switched on and on low dim. This doesn’t just happen at a certain time it happens ALL the time.

Paducah	United States	In the little-kids playground, through the gates, you will be talking and back around the corner you can hear the sound of a bike being slammed up against the gates, but when you walk back there, it stops. There are also voices and footsteps in the halls, especially in the hallway that has the names of the past principals listed. Also, for two miles around it, almost all of the houses have had paranormal activity. No one knows the identity of the school's ghosts, but most of the ghosts in the community are either past owners or past owners' pets. Also, the place used to be a gravel pit. According to myth, many people died on construction of the town, and, to keep people from knowing that some people had died unexplained deaths, there buried them under the town. Of coarse, that's just a myth...

Paducah	United States	A restored mansion, now a rest area, and open to the public. A female apparition has occasionally been sighted on the balcony attached to the second floor bedroom, believed to be the owner's wife. Legend has it she bled to death during an appendectomy. The feeling in that room is very pleasant, however, due to how much she loved that room---her husband had the room and balcony added on especially for her. She has been known to turn off the lights in that room, and the sounds of long skirts swishing as well as the scent of her perfume have been noted.

Park City	United States	A spirit of the cave is a Southern lady named Melissa, who brought her Yankee lover to the cave in 1843. She took the man deep within the cave to Purgatory Point and left him there as a prank. The man was never seen again, and Melissa's ghost still searches the area known as Echo River. The ghost of Floyd Collins, who died after being trapped for sixteen days in nearby Crystal Cave, is also said to wander the grounds. The case became so popular that in 1926, Collins's body was removed from his family plot and displayed in a glass coffin at the entrance to Crystal Cave. The grisly tourist attraction proved very profitable, until someone stole the corpse. It was finally returned to the cave; however, for some reason the body was missing its left leg. In recent years, tourists have reported the unidentified ghost of a man dressed in an old-fashioned cummerbund. Others have witnessed a disembodied pair of legs running down the hill near the main visitors' center. The legs were wearing denim overalls and work shoes. With over 150 sightings of ghosts reported.

It wasn’t pro or anything but it was fun for the guys mostly and their girlfriends would come to watch then race and one time there was a horrible accident and a car wrecked and went into the bleachers and killed more than 15 people and it is believed that the screams are from all the people that died that day. the track is still up there and the guard rails and what’s left of the bleachers is their too. the old buildings that the cars where sometimes kept in are still their too. Kids go up there and use it for paint ball games. People who live behind the area have experienced their roll up shades moving own their own, hearing voices whispering like at night. - June 2008 correction / additional information: The racetrack was known as Lonnie's Speedway and yes it's still there, not in good shape but still there. There was an accident that only the drivers were killed in, not 15 people. Every now and then, no certain time, you can sit on the blacktop road that runs beside the earth walls of the track and hear the wreck happen. There are no homes behind the track, it's all woods. There are houses on the creek past the track, as well as before you get to the track. If you want to find this track I'll tell you how. You go up Lewis Creek, off of US HWY 119 in Partridge. Cross the new state bridge just off 119, then go on up the holler. You'll cross a set of railroad tracks on your way to the track. You will come to a yard with a fairly large house off in the distance and an old barn just off the road; this is Lonnie Lewis' house, and barn. The Lonnie that lives in the house is also the Lonnie that the speedway was named after. The racetrack looks like just a hill, just off the road right past the barn on the left of the road. Make sure ask Lonnie's permission to go to the actual track because he is now old and might think that you're trying to steal something. His son also lives in a camper near the track, behind the barn.

Perry County	United States	Tunnel Hill - Tunnel Hill is located a couple of miles in the back roads of Napfor just before you get to low water bridge. Directly on top of the twin tunnels lie two cemeteries. But forget about the cemeteries for the tunnels are the sites of many bizarre occurrences. The story has it that there is a hidden chamber hidden among the manholes. It is said that the manhole will give way to the secret passage and those who have ventured into this passage have no recollection of how they got there. When walking through the tunnels all light sources will slowly drain and the further you venture into the tunnel total darkness. It is then that random light sources will appear from cracks and crevices on various places in the tunnel. Rather you go in the day or night the same will happen because most occurrences happen once you reach the middle of the tunnel. The right tunnel is much more active than the left. NEVER go alone. Beware these tunnels are still in service and actual trains still pass through each day. One such aspect of the haunting place is the ghost train, which you will actually hear and even feel beneath your feet. Faint train horns echo throughout this terrifying area. Also feel free to explore the large active cemeteries above. Rumors are there many more horrifying things that have happened and continue to happen that cannot be mentioned in this article. - July 2005 Update/Warning: This may not be a safe place to visit. There reports of people being chased out of the tunnels by something unexplained. This can lead to injury or worse.

Radcliff	United States	Until fairly recently (1999 or 2000) this place was off limits to just about everyone. It was part of Ft. Knox, only accessible from a couple of dirt roads across the street from the old US Cav. store. It’s now been opened to the public and made into a park. There are the remains of the old pump houses and tanks for when this was the main water source for Ft. Knox and Radcliff. On all of my visits (both before and after it being opened to the public) I have been plagued with the feeling of being watched. There is also a distinct aura of wrongness about the reservoir. The water is so murky that visibility is about 2ft at most.

Richmond	United States	An apparition haunts the 16th floor of Keene hall at Eastern Kentucky University. A student in his early twenties, late teens, committed suicide from the top floor of the University's dorm hall over a distraught fight with his girlfriend. Feelings of being watched, girls would wake up in the middle of the night and see a man in the room, then they would look twice then nothing was there, weird sounds. Very creepy if you're up there alone.

Richmond	United States	Madison Middle is very old, first it was a civil war hospital which many died in, then a high school now its a middle school. There is said to be a cheerleader that was raped and or murdered in the third floor girls bath room. Very scary sometime when you are in the bathroom alone you can hear weird noises. Sometimes late at night the last stall's door is shut and locked, but the next day when you look there is no one there and the door is completely open. A man was brutally murdered in room 306 in the late 1940's you can still hear sounds of his cry late at night mostly at 1:03 in the morning. - October 2007 Update: There is no proof of guy being murdered. There is a story about a girl on the third floor who was shoved by a bully and hit her head on the sink in the girls bathroom and die. There have been accounts and seen a figure on the third floor. There was one morning a student was helping the social studies teacher carry some things up to her class. It was about 6.45, 7 o'clock. When they got to the third floor and open the door they saw what looked like a young girl running down the hall. They went to investigate because no kids should have been in there at that time and found that the Girls bathroom light was on. There is also a rumor that the school used to be a hospital during the Civil war and is haunted by soldiers who died there.

Richmond	United States	"The Civil War emancipationist, Cassius M. Clay, one of his daughters, one of his sons, and a black servant, haunt the mansion. There have been sightings of Master Clay passing back and forth in front of the top middle window (the nursery), waiting for his ex-wife and children to return. -  June 2005 Update: The Curator at White Hall State Historic Site reports: It is possible that a daughter and son are at White Hall, as numerous incidents site a woman and a little boy. A baby most certainly resides in the mansion. On two separate occasions, in two different seasons, tour guides have heard a baby laughing. Another guide had a small child on her tour remark about seeing babies in the house. The story of Clay passing before the ""top middle window"" (which, incidentally is the third floor hallway, and not a nursery) is a story that the works say they never heard of or experienced at this site. It is doubtful that Cassius would have waited for his ex-wife and children, more likely they would be waiting for him, as he spent a great deal of time away from home campaigning, fighting in the Mexican War, as ambassador to Russia, and in general making a spectacle of himself. In addition to sightings of a lady (although we call her ""the lady in black,"" she is rather stylish and tends to change her clothes, the Curator’s husband has seen her in blue), music has been heard in the mansion (of the piano and music box variety) as well as footsteps. At times one can also smell candles, perfume, apple pie, bourbon and bacon."

It is said that the man who once lived there killed his wife and children. Lack of evidence though, he could not be convicted.

Slade	United States	"As the story goes, about 5 years ago a man from Ohio was up in the mountains of the Red River Gorge enjoying the beauty and scenery of the mountains. As an inexperienced rock climber, he decided to take his chances anyway and go climbing for the day. For the most part, he had a pretty good day--until he decided to climb down to the tunnel (otherwise known as the Nada Tunnel). It was dark outside and he wasn't wearing any bright or distinctive colored clothing and as his luck would have it, his rope broke. Just as he was falling, a big green bus from the job corps came by and hit him as he was falling. To this day, the tunnel still glows from his presence. At 1:17am, the tunnel will glow for 13 minutes (the length of time it took him to die). Witnesses say, as he was dying he mentioned seeing ""the glow"". Now every year on October 29th, at 1:17am, the tunnel glows."

Spotsville	United States	There is a lake down in Spotsville Kentucky. Back in the 1800's It is said that a 13 year old girl had gotten pregnant. And did not want her parents to find out. So she took her baby to the lake, and drowned the baby by throwing it in the lake. Now to this day. When you drive to the lake and park on the dock, turn your car off and headlights. Have nothing on.

The shape was the same but there was mentioning of glowing red eyes and when this being was approached with out fear, he would turn into several black birds and fly toward you. In a valley below the point was a place that was and had been describe as completely barren and dead. The trees, grass and even the branch of water was dry and gone.

Vine Grove	United States	In the downstairs bathroom there was a boy desperate and tired of being picked on. He untied his shoestrings and hung himself in the 2nd stall from the door.

And after night school don't stay around the school for to long cause by personal experience you will see the front door close and feel someone standing right next to you.

About five seconds after the clicking sound you can hear a sound like a bear or a large pack of dogs breathing very hard and the sound gets louder. It sounds like it is right on you ready to harm you, but you cannot see a thing. You can just feel that something is present. The whole time walking out you can still feel its presence. Sometimes it will break branches or knock over small tree, but never to be seen. It has happened in the daylight. The area has a history of weird happenings.

In the last year or so her headstone has been stolen and the shelter over her grave has been vandalized and almost torn apart. It's sad and the submitter has nearly cry every time they see it. They are looking into fixing the shelter themselves. But they cannot afford to replace her headstone, unfortunately. Upon research they have discovered that she is not the witch everyone thinks.

Williamsburg	United States	Gillespie (Johnson) Hall - CC is a small school...everyone knows everyone else (1700 students). The freshman girls dorm has had several incidences on the third floor where they see a girl who does not live there. Sometimes the girl is crying and sometimes she just stares. Other times she is there and disappears. Doors close and open, TV’s and stereos come on and off, radios and computers turn on. Padlocked doors are opened and then when you walk back by (minutes later) it will be locked. Some days it is locked and you can see lights from underneath the door leading up to the attic. It is rumored that she was a cheerleader who got pregnant by a football player and instead of leaving school (strict place here) she killed herself in the attic. She supposedly lived on the third floor in 316. One girl who lived in that room was engaged and at night she would take her ring off and put it on the desk and every morning she would wake up to find it in the garbage.

Winchester	United States	There is a former medical clinic turned museum in downtown Winchester, Kentucky that seems to be haunted. The stories range from footsteps around, and above the listener to doors opening and closing themselves, and even sightings of full body apparitions of former clinic employees. Moving cold spots, fluctuating EMF readings, various orb photos, and such are common in the building especially on the third floor. There have been several very clear EVPs caught in and around the former operating room, and in various places on the third floor of the building, as well as in the former morgue area. The voices captured seem to be that of doctor and nurses talking just before, or during a surgery, and of a man screaming, and moaning in pain. Also, at least one home video exists of heavy footsteps walking, and then running across the floor above the listeners, and of a hallway door shutting itself, opening itself, and then slamming its self shut. The most compelling evidence this video holds is of a lock on the third floor hallway door unexplainably unlatching its self right before your eyes, and the door slowly opening. These events have been witnessed for decades, and by countless numbers of people and as before stated even exists on video. The building is currently open  as a museum for historical tours Tuesday thru Friday for a small admission fee, and plans are in the works to do a half night paranormal tour for Halloween 2008.

Winchester	United States	There is a sharp curve in the road where a car accident happened, killing the passengers in the car. At midnight on a full moon, you can sit on the side of the road down from the curve and wait for the ghost of a woman to appear and walk from the curve toward your car. Witnesses say if you shut your car off, you will have a hard time starting it again and leaving before she can get to you. And if you leave your car running, the engine tries to bog down and die. So far no one has stayed long enough for the ghost to get to them.

Alma	United States	The Alma Cemetery is haunted for two reasons. One is the people who are buried there and refuse to leave. Some pictures have been taken during the night up there. (It's the best time.) The pictures were unbeleivable, there were orbs and mist figures in the pictures. Reason two is the legend of the Devil's Chair. The story is that in the 1800s a real old mean farmer owned the land that is now the cemetery. About that same time Alma was being built. Towns officials had been trying to get him to sell his land so they could use it for the new town's cemetery. But he kept refusing to sell it. One day while at his well getting water someone came up from behind him and pushed him into the well. Than about a week later the town officials come out to the farm to try and to get him to sell again. And one of them noticed a smell from the well. The sheriff said it was nothing and ordered for the well to be boarded and locked and that no one is suppose to talk about. So the farmers land became the town's cemetery. Than in the 1980s some teens decided to go out there and see if they can see the ghost of the old man. One of the teens dared another to sit on top of the closed well. The teen did as he was dared, but suddenly the group heard a sound behind them and turned to see what it was and there was nothing there. So when they turned around to see if there friend was still sitting there. But he wasn't. Thinking that it was a joke he was playing they left and figured they'd see him tomorrow. But the teen was never seen again. Over the years there have been other stories of people sitting on the Devil's Chair and never being seen again. Some people say that it's the farmer reaching through the now old rotted broken boards and getting revenge on the town that took his land away from him. People call it the Devil's Chair because the man was evil when he was alive and is still evil after death.

Alma	United States	Wabaunsee High School is the Haunted by past students and teachers. Most of the students groups are those of students who never got to graduate from the high school because they died while attending it. Teachers and even students have experienced strange things, which occur mostly on the third floor of the building. Things usually occur when someone is on the floor alone. One time the junior- senior class English teacher was alone in her classroom grading paper. Her door is right across the hall for the school’s auditorium and she noticed that the lights in auditorium were flickering on and off and there were voices coming from it. She thought that it was some students that had stayed in the building and were goofing off. So she went to check it but the door was locked, and the kept flickering. So she went to back to her classroom and got her key. As soon as she unlocked and opened the door the lights and the voices stopped. So she peaked in side but saw nothing. As she walked out she was stunned at what she saw, every single locker on the floor was wide open, even the ones that had padlocks on them. She slowly closed the auditorium door and locked it and as she was locking it all the locker doors slammed shut. She was so scared that she left the high school without locking her classroom door. Another time the same teacher was again grading papers by herself in her classroom. She suddenly heard music coming from the auditorium, so she grabbed her key went to the door unlocked it and opened it. She almost passed out at what she saw, she saw a ghostly looking lady playing an instrument. The figure was of a teacher who used to teacher band at the high school, she had died a few years ago of cancer. So when you walk the third floor hall of Wabaunsee High School alone beware of what you might encounter.

Blue Rapids	United States	Upon a hill there is a cemetery. It's unlike any other cemetery; It has no real paths leading up to it. It is an area about one half of an acre where several members of the Schroyer family were buried in the late 1800's. Today only one grave remains, the grave of Mr. Schroyer himself.

Dodge City	United States	(Now Soul Intermediate Center) - An old high school built in the 1800's. The true nature of the haunting has been lost in legend and lies, but one thing still holds true, there are ghosts in the halls in the basement of the school and the library. Several spirits reside within the school, not all of them friendly. There are several passageways that have been blocked off underground the school, legend says a young man was exploring down there after hours, knocked himself out and died shortly there after. Workers were tearing down the set. One of the tear down procedures was two or three of them would walk around the school and take down the flyers promoting the play. they descended to the lowest level where the basement hallways connect with the commons area and the library. While walking into an unlit area they heard the door to the library open and slam and then a laugh. They all sprinted towards the doors, only to find them locked with no one in sight and no one in the library.

Each one getting steeper and steeper and on the last one they actually hit the side of it crushing there car into a very compact box! True story. The town’s police had the car put up on a high wooden platform on the side of the road at the exact spot they died, to teach the rest of the towns teenagers from making the same mistake.

Hartner	United States	it is very very haunted. In the 1st floor men’s room it is always 15 to 20 degrees cooler the rest of the building and you feel as if you are being watched. In the basement there is the old morgue and you can see bloody footprints on the floor, walls and ceiling. On the 3rd floor you will here a toilet flush with no one in the bathroom and the elevator runs up and down on it's own. You can also see the ghost of Charlie Auchenba. There are a number of cold spots and areas where you feel as though you are being watched. You can also see the shadow of a person standing on the ledge in several of the rooms on 3rd floor. I would warn people about going there now cause it was sold and the guy that owns it WILL call the cops on you if you are caught trespassing. However, if you can get permission to check it out it is well worth it.

Hays	United States	"In 1867, a drummer named Ephriam Polly and his wife Elizabeth, stopped at Fort Hays. While staying there, a terrible Cholera epidemic struck the fort. It is not known what happened to Ephriam, but Elizabeth Polly stayed on at the fort tirelessly nursing sick soldiers. In the late afternoon, she would take a moment to walk to her favorite spot that was an isolated hilltop west of the fort. She would rest there and enjoy the peace and quiet. Elizabeth Polly eventually contracted Cholera and died in the fall of 1867. She was given a full military funeral and was buried at her favorite spot on the hilltop. In the 1960's, a marker was erected there that read ""The Lonely Grave."" It is very difficult to get to by vehicle and the last hundred yards must be covered by foot. The ghost of Elizabeth Polly has been seen many times over the years haunting the lonely hilltop that she had frequented so often in life."

Hays	United States	There was a story that said a girl went to a party at Swinging Bridge Park. She got drunk, and she wanted to go home. Her boyfriend offered to take her home, but she refused. She said that she would walk home. When crossing the highway, she was hit by a car and she died. One boy and his friend were biking down the old bike trail that is now shut down. The first time around, they were riding in tall grass, and they caught a glimpse of a pale girl walking in the grass right in front of them. One of the boys swerved to miss her. They turned and looked back, and saw nothing. They went around the trail once more and looked where they almost hit the girl. They didn't see anything. Where she was walking in the tall grass, no evidence was left - no footprints or broken grass. Stumped, the boys kept biking and then suddenly came to a stop. What they saw in frontof them was that same girl in the torn shirt wearing shorts sitting on a high tree branch. The branch was a flimsy branch and it's obvious it wouldn't be able to support more than about maybe 10 pounds. Yet stumped again, the boys took another trip around the trail and saw nothing.

Lawrence	United States	Haskell is a know sight for countless paranormal activity. The campus itself dates back to the 1800's when the US Government built Haskell Institute to help control the Native American population and assimilate them into mainstream America. Native American children were taken from their reservations and sent to schools like Haskell to teach them how to be white Americans. All aspects of their Native American heritage was stripped from them and they were forced to act as the Government felt appropriate. Countless reports and documents held in the National Archives office in Kansas City tell stories of children beaten and abused for using their Native tongue, or for acting out of conduct. The University of Kansas forensic labs hold several remains of children found buried throughout the Haskell Campus. Many rumors are speculated about some of the Universities buildings, which are all some of the oldest in the state of Kansas. Haskell is an amazing place for those who seek an up and close experience with the paranormal. The history and horror that this campus holds is unlike any other place in the world. So, if you are daring, ask for a key to Hiawatha Hall and see if you can stand to be alone in the building for more than one evening.

Lawrence	United States	Just south of Taminend Hall - there is a small cemetery with about 70 markers of children who died from a smallpox epidemic that plagued the city of Lawrence for a good year. When you approach the cemetery don't be afraid if you start to hear the sound of children crying. This is a common occurrence and has been the reason for several Native ceremonies to try to bring peace to these children who died here. One medicine man says that the children will only stop crying when they have been returned to their home lands.

The location was a gnarled tree at the top of flowertop and sure enough there stood a small dead tree that stood out from the rest. ""Historians"" dug up around the tree and found the diary. The woman talked about how the Indians were peaceful but the last entry out of nowhere stated. ""Indians Hostile"". It is along with the story that every settler was murdered and to this day that gnarled tree still stands. The odd thing about the tree is that it leans north and its branches point north while everything on the other side of it is dead, but the trees around it lean south and the north sides the dead or dieing branches. - **A few more points of interest about this place** It has been rumored that a cult was active in this very location back in the late 80s and early 90s and cows around the area were found dead with one thing wrong, their utters were sliced off, but not by animals because the cuts were too strait and clean. Those utters were then sacrificed by the cult on flowertop, a trail that no cow could have taken leads to the top."

Every night after closing time when the manager is the only one left he locks himself in. He then sets about pushing tables to the back and stacking chairs after which he retires to his office for a smoke. More times then would probably be desired he comes back to find the tables pushed back out and the chairs untracked. Both put back in their original positions by unseen hands.

Park City	United States	One of the ghost was murdered back in these woods several years ago. It was by her husband who had caught her in a deep love affair. Little did he now that she was pregnant. Now her soul can't rest. So she takes it out on the kids who travel this trail. The second tale of a different ghost is a strange one. Jacob was riding his bike down the trail. This trail is a pretty easy to ride on except for one spot. We know it as deadman's curve. We'll when he got to this spot he was picking up speed so he tried to slam on the brakes. But for some reason his brakes were not working. So he road his speeding death trap down the wrong path. His front tire hit a root sticking up from the ground and it sent him flying head first into a tree. His lifeless body floated down the creek never to be seen again. Some say it was the wife who killed him.

Parsons	United States	"An explosion in the late 1980s killed two workers, a man and a woman, and closed the plant for more than two years. When work resumed in 1990, just in time for the Persian Gulf War, part of the building was closed. To prevent sympathetic detonation in case of an accident, work areas were located several hundred yards apart, connected by ramshackle, unpainted, wasp-infested wooden ramps. Inspectors, supervisors and parts managers rode old-fashioned bicycles with wire handlebar baskets between areas. They used thumb-operated bicycle bells to alert other bikers and ""pedestrians"" before crossing an intersection or entering an adjoining hallway. As production of the cluster bombs continued -- with 202 bombs tucked inside each one -- rumors spread that the workers killed by a single exploding bomblet was haunting the closed area of the plant. Only two of the employees who survived the explosion returned to the plant, but they each began to have nightmares about their former co-worker; one was being chased through the dark, wooden ramps by the woman, whose face was destroyed in the blast by flying shrapnel. The other survivor was plagued by visions of a male co-worker being vaporized from the waist up by the explosion, his legs, shielded by the thick steel work table, beginning to turn and run without its upper body. In the dreams, they kept running. Finally, one night two inspectors and a parts manager decided to explore the closed ramp. There were no lights in the area, and the workers hadn't thought to bring a flashlight. Still, they crept ahead into the dark. About 100 feet or so up the hall, the air cooled noticeably. The men walked a few feet further until, from around a bend ahead of them, they heard it: a metallic ringing. A bicycle bell rang twice in the pitch black, abandoned hall. Brrrng, brrrng! Then, after a pause, twice more: Brrrng, brrrng! The men, already nervous because of the dark and cold, fled back down the ramp to the light. After catching their breath, they agreed they had heard a bicycle bell, precisely the type bell used by the company's supervisors, inspectors, etc. for transportation in the labyrinthine plant. They agreed that the sound had come from ahead of them, not behind, and they agreed it wasn't likely anyone could have been in the ramp ahead of them with a bicycle."

Towanda	United States	It is said that this grocery used to be an orphanage and also a home for wayward woman. Truckers used to sleep in the basement of the building. This is one of the oldest buildings in Towanda. Many of the women that worked at the grocery have said to see potato chips, grocery carts moving on their own, the smell of fresh coffee, and cold air coming from no where. One lady that was closing up for the evening had put up all of the mops and brooms on hangers for the night and also checked the freezer to make sure it was closed up tight. The next morning when she opened the store the freezer door was wide open and all of the brooms and mops were lying on the floor in one little pile. Another Lady said to have something come up and touch her on her head and play with her hair. Something was always untying their aprons. Each time a person could feel the cold chill in the air and the hair rise on their arms.

Albany	United States	"In the basement there is an elevator that leads to the sub-basement. The sub-basement goes down another four floors and is nicknamed ""the dungeon"". It was said that when workers were laying the cement for the sub-basement a co-worker went mysteriously missing, his lunch and house keys were found but he wasn't. It was assumed that when laying the cement floor he must have fallen in and no one saw it happen. People who are new to the building are told about this ghost and the name given to him, ""Jason."" (for no real reason)To this day there have been many reports from people who travel down there for old documents and books. He will travel with you up the old steel elevators and you will get chills that will go all over your body. It feels like you have walked into a cold spot. And as soon as the chills start they will stop again. He will turn on the lights after they have been turned off (maybe to read so old books). He has also been known to help people look for books that they can't find. Books will mysteriously fall off of shelves and it will be the book that you were looking for. People say that they can feel him watching them work when they work down in ""the dungeon"". Many people have seen him out of the corner of their eye, but as soon as you turn your head to look at him he's gone again. He's also scared a few people enough to never want to go down there alone or again but he has never harmed anyone. He's become a part of everyday life with all of the people who work in the sub-basement."

Albany	United States	Professor Java's Coffee Sanctuary - Middle age gentlemen seen in walking past mirrors but when you turn there is no one there. Workers hear noises at night and sometimes lights come off and on. Spirit does not like to be around when there are many people but late during the night you get a strange feeling of heaviness and even hairs sticking up on your arms. A spirit of a dog can also be sometimes heard and seen. Building has gone many extensive renovations. It was once an old house, and then renovated to a hair stylist, it also has been reported by several people to have been at one time a secret illegal meth production house that was shut down. Spirit has been felt standing behind people and in some cases breathing down their necks behind them or being lightly touched or pushed. The activity stems from the basement. Some workers refuse to go down there by themselves.

Albany County	United States	GE Plastics - The site of GE in Selkirk used to be the Becker farm. It is over 300 acres. The original farm house is still intact and was occupied on and off with offices until March of 2004. There had been many stories from employees on what they had seen or heard. The story goes that Mr. Becker caught his wife having sex with one of the slaves. He took the slave and pushed him down a very narrow out of the way set of slave stairs and he died, he then took a knife and killed his wife by cutting her head off or attempting to anyway. He was so grief stricken about his wife having an affair and the fact that he killed her, he went to the basement and hung himself. When in the basement sometimes the lights will all blow out or other things will turn on and off. And when on the second floor where he supposedly killed his wife there is a strange smell, kind of like perfume. And when going up or down the slave stairs you get a strange sense of being watched or followed. There are also motion detectors and intrusion alarms. some guards say there that sometimes they will go off, when the building is completely empty. And they will go off in a strange order, sometimes near the basement and then almost immediately near the stairs. Sometimes it appears as if someone is walking through. They will check the system to see who accessed the Becker House and see that no one has.

Annandale-on-Hudson	United States	Blithewood Mansion - Students and faculty have long reported noises and poltergeist activity at the mansion. Sightings of a ghostly young girl between the ages of 8-12 have also been mentioned in the house and the surrounding gardens. The spirit is believed to be the daughter of Captain Andrew C. Zabriskie, the former owner and builder of the house. One winter their daughter either fell or jumped to her death out the window of their New York apartment and it is said she remains at the summer house because she disliked Manhattan while alive. An eerie postscript: before her death, Capt. Zabriskie commissioned a sculptor to create 4 statues of her for each 3 years of her life up to the age of 12 in the gardens; but to this day only three statues are present, along with an empty pedestal for the fourth one.

Aurora	United States	The Main Building - Wells College actually has a number of ghost stories. One of the most prevalent however, is that of the ghostly nurses. Many years ago, when a brutal influenza epidemic swept the nation, many students fell ill. The college then turned the fourth floor of the main building into an infirmary. Students who live there today will occasionally wake in the middle of the night to find a ghostly nurse standing over their beds. Some witnesses even claim that the ghost will go as far as to place a cold hand upon the student's forehead.

Baldwinsville	United States	It is a 5 mile road with no street lights or houses. It is all forest. It is said that back in the old days devil worshipers and members of the KKK used to worship up there and kill children as sacrifices...it is said that if you drive down the road at night you can see the children walking and there is also a bloody blanket. it is a very eerie feeling.- June 2005 Update/ Correction: The story of the KKK and satanic rituals is most likely false. Rumors are told that at some point in the past it was told that a man had been wrongly convicted of committing murder. Either as punishment or in holding before his punishment he was placed in a small shack at the end of Whiskey Hollow Road. Due to some mysterious circumstances the man died in that shack before his execution or during his incarceration there.

Brewster	United States	"There are several, seemingly, unrelated stories about this road which starts as Federal Hill Road in Brewster, New York and ends as Joe's Hill Road in Danbury, Connecticut. The most pronounced story is that of the Jesus Tree (cut down in the early 1990's). This tree with the image of Jesus on the crucifix was said to ""bleed"" a red substance from its trunk when they cut it down. There are twelve trees evenly spaced and equal in stature directly following where the Jesus Tree stood. These are said to be the twelve apostles. When you travel farther down the road (eastbound), you come to a very curious looking estate. this ominous looking estate is actually Morefar Golf Club. This is believed to be a cover for something else. Word of links to the Satanic church have been bantered about. The main entrance has a sign reading ""Back 'o Beyond"". Interesting welcome for a country club. Immediately following Morefar, and across the street is Farrington Pond. There have been several stories about people driving off the road, into the pond, claiming to have seen ""something"". The undifinitive story of this pond is that a young lady, on her way to a High School Prom, went off the road and into the pond. She was said to have drowned. When the moonlight hits the water, people have been known to see an image in a prom dress on top of the water, dancing - alone. In 1988, a young man named Dean, was found in his car on the side of the pond (just off the road), dead from gun shot wounds to the back of his head. The two men who were responsible were captured within a week. It is unknown whether this has anything to do with the spirit of the pond, but, if nothing else, it adds to the eeriness of the road."

Brockport	United States	Brockport -  Hartwell Hall - Hartwell Hall was the first building on the SUNY Brockport campus, originally used as the Brockport Normal School, a school for teachers. Cleaning staff over the years have claimed to experience things when they are alone in the building. One spoke of a periodic flurry of ghostly activity in the hallways on one of the upper floors when spirits change classes -- doors sounding as if they're opening and closing, faint laughter and voices in the hallways... Another staff member swore she was touched on the shoulder while cleaning a classroom, only to turn around and find no one. She also said she was cleaning one of the ballet rooms and, slipping from her stepladder and falling backwards, was caught by an unknown force and set down gently, unharmed. In the basement, where an empty pool sits, workers are sure they've heard splashing.

Bronx	United States	In the fields at the edge of this small beach town, stands an old abandoned farmhouse overlooking the water. People say that a large mansion once accompanied the farmhouse. The residents of the mansion were very wealthy and many people were jealous of them. One man went to the extreme and caught their house on fire. The entire house was destroyed, but the family was able to escape to the farmhouse in time. The police came to investigate, but feared the people of Silver Beach would move if they heard about the arson. The police simply said that there was a tragic fire and the family had died. They even went as far as to say the field could be used for children to play. The suspect was never found, and the family continued to live secretly in the farmhouse. In 1950, ten years after the fire, the suspect who set the fire returned. He murdered the entire family the night before Halloween by stabbing them to death. The next evening, a group of teenagers came to the field to hang out. The young daughter, who had been able to escape the murderer, was going crazy looking for her family. The teens watched in horror as she ran to the water and dived in. She drowned instantly, since she was unable to swim. They reported the incident to the police.

Buffalo	United States	A husband & wife who were archaeologists, went on a dig at Grand Island in the early 1970s through SUNY Buffalo.  First, they said there was a terrible vibe between the people on the team, who were normally good friends. People were making bad decisions and snapping at each other and acting completely unlike themselves. Then, when everyone sat down for lunch, they all heard growls coming from the surrounding woods. The couples were experienced with life outdoors even then and they both said it was not the growl of any animal native to western NY. The growling seemed to surround them and things rustled in the trees.  They all packed up and left. My parents told me that there are a lot of Native American spirits there, possibly a burial site.

Buffalo	United States	Located on Main Street, many of the students and staff have reported seeing several nuns on 3rd floor in old dormitories. Nuns would go and ring the church bell (its no longer functioning) but students can't hear the bell due to their hearing impairments but there are no reports of sounds but a lot of visuals. A little boy was reported to be seen on campus walking around Bosco Hall since it used to have a swimming pool and now converted into a small gym.

Camden	United States	Many years ago, a man who worked at the high school was fixing the lights in the auditorium. By some freak accident, he fell to his death. There were bloodstains on the carpet. To this day, the auditorium will become wicked cold without anybody touching the thermostat, and also lights will go on and off by themselves. Kids who have meetings in the room often complain about feeling someone hit them in the head, or someone poking them, and to come to find nothing is to be found. Once it was even said that during a play that was taking place, a man was interrupted by feeling his sneakers and socks getting wet because of some red liquid type on the floor. Come to find out that's where the man's bloodstain was. The incident was never solved and people still don't know how or what the red stuff was. Early in the morning, you can here a man screaming and a loud thump when you walk past the auditorium, to find nothing and nobody there. The death of the man was covered up, but it sounds like he is coming back and making people aware that he is there.

Camden	United States	On fourth Street is the old Charlie Harden House. Built in the mid 1800's, Charlie Harden, a wealthy man, had this house built where he later died. There have been more than a few sightings of the ghost of Mr. Harden in the ornate foyer, and on the curving stair case connecting to it. Cold spots abound in the house even though extensive work to the work house was completed. The sounds of someone walking on the long curving stairs and landing are often heard mainly in the late afternoon. Children who have lived in the house tell stories of the nocturnal knockings on bedroom doors and walls, and of the bad dreams that accompany them.

Elbridge	United States	"formerly known as Webbers Wayside Inn. The story goes, that many years ago a traveler from out of town was staying at this specific inn, on the second or third floor. The man had a heart attack and died one evening, his spirit never leaving the hotel again. People who have worked there for a time will tell you it was nothing for them to feel a cold spot, for a female to feel a touch on her body as she walked through an empty room, and on one occasion, a case of beer floating. The staff at this Inn have affectionately called this ghostly presence George.

Fort Covington	United States	This old Victorian mansion, once owned by occult writer Gerina Dunwich, is known by local residents to be haunted. In the early 20th century, a mentally disturbed woman was believed to have been locked away in one of the small attic rooms. She died there, leaving bloodied hand prints on the walls and ceiling. Several coats of primer and paint were necessary to cover the stains. The room contains a cold spot and several séances have been held there in an attempt to contact the restless spirit. Strange thumps have also been heard in the attic at night. Glowing lights have been seen moving through the cellar, and a ghostly presence has been felt by numerous people in the upstairs bedrooms.
