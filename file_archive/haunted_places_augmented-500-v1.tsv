Ada	United States	"Ada witch - Sometimes you can see a misty blue figure floating within a 3-mile radius of the Ada Cemetery on 2 Mile between Egypt Valley and Honey Creek. The story of her origin is as follows: A man suspected his wife of having an affair, so he followed her late one night when she thought he was asleep. Sure enough, she went to a field near their property where she met her lover. The husband was enraged and killed his wife, which resulted in a struggle with the other man. Both men died from their injuries. It is said that late at night (especially during the night of and the nights preceding a full moon) people driving by the field can see her ghost, searching for her lover. Some people have reported stopping to try to communicate with her, but she always disappears or runs into the woods where she cannot be followed (due to the thick brambles that inhabit the area). She is said to dress in a long white gown which authorities say dates her to the turn of the 20th century. Usually she is seen alone, but sometimes witnesses report seeing a ghostly death scene re-enacted... Others report seeing nothing at all but hearing the killer's shouts of rage followed by the victims' screams of agony... Although it is said she haunts the field on Honeycreek Road where she died, other witnesses have reported her in nearby Seidman Park, and in nearby Findlay Cemetery, where she is supposedly buried. This story was actually featured in the book ""Ghosts of Grand Rapids."""	Ada Cemetery	Michigan	MI	-85.50489309999999	42.9621061	-85.4954803	42.960727	Egypt Valley Country Club	43.0125	-85.50056

The day of her funeral she started knocking on doors of the house she was born in.1 month later as her clothes were to be removed the doors in the home flew open with no reason. Cold spots now can be felt & knocking at the door is still present to this day in the home. Also when there swings in the yard you could see them swing real high as if someone was swinging on them. lights like to go on & off in this home & she does move things to let someone know she is there. The cemetery where this child lies has had alot of activity also. When you visit her grave she has a twirly that will start going around & round with no reason or wind blowing to let you know she is present. Some have said she has been spotted walking the cemetery very restless as if she doesn't realize she has passed on.	North Adams Rd.

Adrian	United States	If you take Gorman Rd. west towards Sand Creek, you will come to a gravel road leading north. A mile or so up this road you will come to narrow one lane trestle bridge. The road goes under this. Legend has it that at one time there was a farm house built near the tracks. Late one night a fire broke out in the barn. While the father ran to the barn to try to get the horses out, his wife and young son went to the tracks to wave down one of the many trains that would use that right of way. They were too close to the tracks however and both were struck by the train as it went past. The father was killed in the barn. Now if you go out there late at night, you can sometimes communicate with the Father. He will not allow you to talk to his wife or son; as if he was protecting them . There are other people living in the area now, and a large streetlight has been placed there by the people who own the neighboring land. If you stay there to long, they will call the police. However if you make your visit short enough they will usually leave you to it. This place has also been described as a good place to go to contact other spirits. The Father can be asked to help in this matter. He will not allow antagonistic spirits to talk however; once again to protect his family.

Adrian	United States	In the 1970's, one room, room 211, in the old section of the dorms exhibited several phenomena. Don't know if this still continues today. The door into the room from the hallway, as well as the door into the bathroom, would open and shut on their own, the main door even if it had been locked. After closing, it would be locked again. There was also a spot on one wall (a wall that the room shared with a boarded up, no longer used laundry shaft) where two points of light would appear, shaped similar to eyes. Attempts were made to explain their appearance (they were visible any time it was dark in the room). They were screened off from the windows to see if they might be reflections, they weren't. When objects were placed between them and the windows they actually became brighter. We tried painting the walls, putting several coats of paint over them (thinking they may have been a joke of a previous resident, made with glow in the dark paint) - also having used sandpaper on the wall in that spot first before painting. They still appeared bright as ever after the painting. We tried covering them over by hanging a picture over them, but the picture kept falling down or moving. Last attempt to hang picture (it was a drawing on a piece of paper and simply taped to the wall) resulted in us waking up the next morning to find it taped to the ceiling over my bed. We finally moved a tall dresser in front of it and that seemed to take care of it. Reports from later residents told us that they had placed a mirror over it, and they had a rocker in the room. One night during a party, with several witnesses, the rocker began rocking on its own, then flew back and smashed the mirror. Have had no contact with the school since graduation, so don't know if these things still happen or not.

Algoma Township	United States	On a winding dirt road next to the Rogue River called Friske, there is a small turn-around for no particular reason. On this turn-around, there is a trail that leads off a ways into the woods. If you follow the trail, it leads to an old iron bridge called Hell's Bridge. It is said that if you are sitting or standing on the bridge at midnight you can hear the devil laughing. The reason is, in the 1800's, when Algoma didn't really exist and Rockford was known as Laphamville, a man named Elias Friske murdered several children and claimed a demon made him do it. Later the bodies were found in the part of the river where the bridge is now. Sometimes you can also hear the children crying, @r the noise of splashing water where their bodies were thrown. Some fishermen in the early morning have reported seeing a strange figure near the bridge...	Hell's Bridge	Michigan	MI			-85.62292959999999	43.1492928	Rogue River	42.43595	-123.172

Ann Arbor	United States	Mercywood was a mental hospital before closing down. security guards heard the elevators moving when the building was empty. Sounds would come from the boiler room. In the basement were personal belongings of the inmates. There was also a bowling alley and bumper pool tables in the basement. There were insane rambling written on the walls in some of the rooms. Behind the hospital there was a convent where the nuns lived that worked in the hospital and even to go in there was a very uneasy feeling. It is like you can feel the insanity that surrounded the place. Also an evil feeling. They have since torn down the old hospital but something has been built there recently. It is on Jackson Ave. in Ann Arbor a little way down from the cemetery next to I-94 on the right side if you are going west.

Central Lake	United States	The Lamplights Inn has been a landmark in Central Lake since 1924. It was built in the very early 1900s. Beginning in the early '50s, the successive owners have had persistent reports of ghosts. A man and woman dressed in late '20s - early '30s garb have been seen many times over the years, not only by owners' families, but also by employees and customers alike. The descriptions are uncannily similar. A customer recently reported the man and woman ghosts dancing together in the bar area with a little girl ghost looking on. These ghosts also window peep (on the second floor). They certainly appear to be fun loving. Another story tells of the daughter of a former hotel manager, who was preparing to elope with her fiancée, and tripped on her gown while descending the ladder. She fell to her death and returns to walk the hallway upstairs in her wedding gown. And, it is a fact that Mrs. Gill who, with her husband, were the first managers of the hotel, returned and lived out her remaining years at the hotel. She died in the early '50s in one of the upstairs bedrooms. Many people have reported seeing her stand in the upstairs window looking onto the village. In 1979 Ted Strzempek bought the lamplight he said he was in the upstairs hallway painting when a women in a white dress ran by him and through all the boxes he had stacked by the wall she ran into a bedroom and he ran in after her only to find an empty room. The Murphy's now own the lamplight and if you ask them if the lamplight is haunted they will not deny it.

Harrison	United States	There are many stories about this house. One is the mother (Mrs. Reinke) was standing in her kitchen putting away groceries, and looked up and saw twin daughters (around 6 years old) holding hands and walking toward her. They walked right past her and out the door down towards Budd Lake. Another story is the large man story. Mr. Reinke was tying up his boat when he looked up into his bedroom window and saw a large figure of a man in the window. He rushed up to make sure everything was ok and when he got there, nothing was in the room. Soon after, another sighting of this large man happened. The daughter was sleeping when she noticed that a light was coming from her closet. The way the light comes through the window it would be impossible to be shining into the closet. She looked away, and when she looked back, saw a large man in her closet, the same man her dad had seen earlier. She described the man looking just the way her dad had seen, and he hadn't told anyone about the man yet (he didn't want to look stupid). The next day, the whole family was out of the house, and no one had been there all day. When the daughter came home, she found her room in total shambles, everything in the closet had been thrown around, and figurines and other possessions where seen lying on the ground. Another story has to do with the son. One night he could hear a bouncing ball in the attic above his room. He hears it about once every month or so, and if he gets annoyed with it, he tells the ghost or whatever is bouncing the ball to quit, and it usually does. He is very used to it, and it doesn't scare him anymore to hear it. All of the son's friends are afraid to sleep in the house, and will not really sleep in any rooms alone.

Ionia	United States	Years ago, there was an accident at Oak Hill Cemetery, the other cemetery in Ionia, in which five kids went in at night, though it's not sure what they went in for. One of them had urged the others to leave several times, but they did not listen. By 3 A.M that night, four of them were dead, and the last kid survived in the scatter, but refused to explain what had happened, or how he'd survived, to police or anyone.  On the first Saturday of every month between 2 and 3 A.M, if survived walks to the gate, and waits to safely guide you through. It seems as though he can protect you now in death, though he couldn't protect them in life.

Just west of that is a long lay of Grand River Valley land that once was the lumbertown of Austerlitz. There is much forgotton and paved-over history there. In the 1980's motorists returning home from Grand Rapids at night told of a woman who stood on the corner of Brewer and Cannonsburg roads she wore no coat, though the weather at the times during which she appeared was always disagreable. She was seen in cold rains and wet snows. This rural area just at the edge of town was not completely desolate so there are no stories of motorists stopping to offer the apparition a ride. As the stories go, she never thumbed or indicated in any way that that she was in distress, she just stood there enduring the elements. Could she have been a live person? Doubtfull, Homes were far enough away from Oakwood that there would have been no reason for a young woman to stand out on that corner late at night in nasty weath with no coat.

Lambertville	United States	Verna Drive - Update: The following reported haunting is a hoax.- The Monroe County Paranormal Society have just investigated this claim and their contacts in the sheriff's department tell them that there has never been such a murder in the entire county, let alone in the quiet of Bedford Township. Also Lambert Estates also has never existed. One also has to wonder how such a horrific tragedy as the game show story never even made it to the local news. - Off Monroe Road in Lambertville, Michigan, there is a subdivision called Lambert Estates. Lambert Estates is mostly made up of a road called Verna Drive. The subdivision was formed in 1957. In the early summer of 1978, Steven Madison, a 33-year-old worker for a glass plant in Toledo, Ohio, walked into a home on Verna Drive and killed an elderly couple with a hammer found in the garage. He then moved into several other houses that night, and killed 7 others. 3 male adults, 1 female adult, 2 male children, and 2 female children. He used a block of firewood to kill a family of 3, a wood saw to kill a young college graduate, and smothered or strangled the other 3. He then went into the woods next to the neighborhood and hung himself from a maple tree. Reports of screams often come from two houses in the neighborhood. In the early July's, residents report a figure of a man walking down the street carrying a piece of firewood wearing a green shirt and jeans that appear to be blood stained. A neighbor once approached the man after seeing him 3 consecutive nights. When the man was asked who he was, he turned and faced the resident with a frightening wide grin and wide eyes. He walked off after not responding and disappeared in the front yard of an residents house. He was also reported seen in the woods, hanging from a tree, when the owner of the woods walked in one evening while walking his dog. He noticed nothing out of the ordinary at first, until when standing under a tree; drops of water fell on him. He looked up and saw him hanging by his neck as if he just died. The water was apparently tears that the man shed. An investigation was conducted to investigate the level of paranormal activity. The investigation was part of a game show where a group of people spent a week in the now abandoned neighborhood, to determine whether it was haunted. By the end of the week, a member of the investigating team disappeared and had not been found until two months later. He was found nearly dead in the glass plant in Toledo wear Steven Madison was employed. To this day the neighborhood remains empty, yet still stands. - June 2008 Update - The first posting for Lambert estates indicates it is abandoned. The update then states that the neighborhood never existed. Actually, not only has it existed, it remains very much occupied to this day. Every house is very well maintained. However, it is not in Temperance, it is in Lambertville, the next town over.	formerly listed in Temperance	Michigan	MI	-83.62601099999999	41.75810800000001	-83.624201	41.75290880000001	Lambertville	40.36594	-74.94294

Mackinac Island	United States	When the Mission House (now state employee housing) was built it was at the heart of a Christian mission to convert Indians who lived on the island. When Indian children who were living there became sick with TB they were locked in the cool damp basement because it was thought that this would help them. It didn't. State employees report the ghosts of children all over the basement and first two floors of the house. The attic is less haunted but people feel presences and alarm clocks get tipped over. The forms of children can be seen walking around often at night inside. Reportedly, none of the presences are not hostile.

Manitoulin Island	United States	- Drummond Island - Drummond Island is said to be haunted by two ghosts of headless British soldiers. During the War of 1812 there where two British soldiers who went AWOL, and a price was placed on their heads. Two Indians near the fort ran off on snowshoes to pursue the deserters. The deserters had built a fire to warm themselves on Manitoulin Island (in Canada now) and began to doze while sitting by their large blaze. The Indians snuck up behind them and with a few swift chops of their hatchets the soldiers were decapitated. The Indians brought their heads back to the fort and collected their bounty. Now people say sometimes you can see a fire burning on the shore and two headless figures pacing around it. Some people claim to have driven up quite close in their boat and had the whole scene disappear before them.

Marine City	United States	"Once in a great while employees of the kitchen claim that machines will turn on when no one is around, such as mixers, dishwasher, etc. The very rare occasions have pretty much stopped but just recently in the summer of 2003 a radio/C.D. player boombox was said to ""have a mind of it's own"". It started with the volume increasing by it's self over the corse of 5-10 minutes to the point where it was full blast and had to be turned down. But a little while later it would turn it's self up again, blaring loud and causing frusteration among employees. One Sunday morning during a busy breakfast rush, a frusterated employee turned the power button off since it wouldn't stay at a reasonable volume level. Minutes later the radio suddenly turned on loud as can be. The red-faced employee turned it off again, and five minutes later the words ""sugar, sugar, oh honey, honey!"" came blaring out of the speakers (the radio station was placed at 104.3, oldies station). The employee grabbed the radio, unplugged it and sat it underneath a table. This ended the incents for that day and the night crew workers claimed they had no problems with the radio at all after they plugged it in that same night. All week the radio was fine until Sunday morning came. The breakfast buffet near the dining room was getting busy and kitchen workers became busy as well. The radio started turning it's self up again. The same employee from last Sunday battled it for 2 hours having to turn the volume down every 10-15 minutes. Everyone thought it was broken or something. He eventually turned it off and became very frusterated. And about 20 minutes later, the song ""Edge Of Seventeen"" by Stevie Nicks suddenly blared from the radio. The employee stared at the radio shaking his head as workers yelled for him to turn it down. He gritted his teeth, unplugged it, and wrapped the cord around it. It remained silent and still for an hour until it suddenly ""hurled it's self towards him"" but missed him by a few inches and hit the floor. The radio was permanently shot and would not work after this incident. Other strange incidents involved objects disappearing (knives, utinsils, etc.) while employees were just using them seconds earlier. After searching the kitchen for them they would be neatly placed where the cooks had originally placed them. Also, the same employee that dealed with the radio incident claimed that vegetables such as squash, potatoes, etc. would be neatly placed on a cutting board but nobody needed them and would have to be put back. This also occured with other items. One time a 5-gallon jug of milk was found sitting on a table in the kitchen. After checking the milk machine it was full with milk. He asked around if anyone got the milk out. Puzzled, the waitresses said no. He placed the milk jug back in the walk in refrigerator. He began chopping up some vegetables when all of the sudden an entire shelf of pizza pans (about 15 inches wide and 30 inches high) fell spreading loud bobbling pizza pans all over the floor. Seconds later 3 metal hotel pans fell off a shelf causing a he racket. The frusterated employee walked out, but returned the next day for work. This was like the grand finale for the poltergeist, if it even was a poltergeist, because nothing has happened since for several months. These events started out of the blue and only lasted two weeks and then abruptly stopped. Even before they occured nothing unusual ever happened there for years."

Mount Morris	United States	During the 1980's and through the 1990's many bodies were dumped in this junk yard. Most of them were do to professional killings. Since this place was once a hot spot to dump bodies it has become very much haunted. There have been reports of screams coming from the junkyard during the night. Also many police reports have been done on the sighting of people standing by the road. When the motorist would stop to help these people they would be gone. One wild report states that the motorist believed he hit a person but no damage was found on the car. This Junk Yard has and is becoming a smoking hot spot for ghosts and Hauntings. The owner of the yard now makes sure the place is always closed before dark and there has been a for sale sign in front of this yard for more than three years going. No one wants to buy the property. - June 2008 Update/Correction: The pervious owner reports there were never any bodies found in the junkyard, but, another previous owner was murdered by his wife's boyfriend. The murder has been featured on court TV. The new owner does claim that there is some paranormal activity in the office where he was murdered at(doors slamming and odd noises). She says she just tells him to take a seat and nothing happens after that. It is private property so there is absolutely NO TRESPASSING. There is a heavy police presence in the area. If you call or visit during business hours she is more than willing to share her stories and she seemed open to have an investigation as long as you clear it with her.

Mount Pleasant	United States	Warriner Hall - long ago there was a young actress who frequented Warriner Hall (CMU campus). Evidently at some performance or rehearsal...she was downstairs from a friend of hers and decided to call up to this friend using the Dumbwaiter shaft that had been out of commission for some time. As she leaned her head in, the dumbwaiter came crashing down and beheaded her! Since the incident, there have been a few sightings. A mysterious blue lighting accompanies her spirit, and she has never been seen by a crowd...generally she is seen by actors or stage hands working alone. She seems a bit of a prankster, dropping lights, or gels or ladders.  December 2003 Addition or update: Some say it was a cleaning lady who died in the dumbwaiter and she was cleaning it out and people see her on the stage singing	Central Michigan University	Michigan	MI	-84.7756364	43.5819086	-84.7675139	43.59780749999999	Central Michigan University	43.5819086	-84.7756364

Mount Pleasant	United States	This building used to be one of the most used State Mental hospitals for the criminally insane. There they would house people that would range from serial killers to rapists, but no matter the crime they were there for good...And they deserved to be. This place was never fenced in, didn't have electrical locking doors, and even let their patients wander freely on the grounds. Consequently many escaped. Nowadays the place is shut down. Too many people escaped and horrible things happened towards it's end. Such things like an orderly living in the houses provided for them just a few hundred feet away from the hospital was subject to the torture of one of the patients. She was raped and killed. Several of the escaped patients would harm civilians or stalk them....And finally the city of Mt. Pleasant closed down this hell hole. Hardly any information can be found on it now. It's really a very closed and touchy subject...but if you travers on the grounds, you'll find many disturbing things. Blood stains on the floors of the hospital, the yard for the children (eerie in and of itself becaue they housed children next to criminals)and even in broad daylight you can see and FEEL the presence of these spirits. There's a chain on the wall of one of the buildings that's completly sealed off....this is where they would chain like dogs the patients they didn't want wandering off more than the others...The place itself is imposing to visit let alone when the ghosts come out at night. Their moaning and wailing can be heard and their forms can be seen....(There are police that regularly patrol the grounds warding off college kids and protecting the other buildings on the property still running, but the state mental wards are closed)	Mt.

Muskegon	United States	"The Northshore Hospital was once used for TB patients. Later it was converted and housed the mentally ill. After funding ran out the hospital was closed and abandoned. The eerie dwelling was a huge brick building looming on the outskirts of the quaint town of North Muskegon. Inside you could feel the evil among the dank walls which were covered in graffiti with readings such as ""the house of the dead"", ""I can see you"", and many odd pictures of creatures and eyes. The basement of the old dwelling was the most energetic place in the entire hospital. Cold drafts and unexplained noises filled the empty hallways. It was the most terrifying, strange place to experience. - September 2004 update: the hospital has been destroyed.

Northville	United States	In the old city of Northville in the 40's and 50's, were many insane asylums. They were not even a mile apart and ran through the whole town. They were all linked underneath the ground, for underground passages of very mentally ill patients and there's rumors that that's where many of the out of control patients were punished, not to alarm the others. The tunnels go all through the town, and under buildings, which are now on the place of the asylums. The tunnels are blocked off but the people who are brave enough to go in have experienced screaming, voices, moaning and orbs. Feelings of people behind you, crashes against the walls, and more. The tunnels are miles long and are tight compacted areas. There is a 200 dollar fine for anyone to go there, seeing as the late 80's and 90's brought many Satanists there trying to summon up spirits. -  Update: The buildings of the insane asylum have now been torn down and they are building a sub-division on the land. They had tried many times to get a company to come and build there and always something went wrong. They finally got some company to build expensive homes there and now there is a worry for the people who purchase their homes there. It is the whole block on the north-east corner of Sheldon and 5 mile roads.	Northville Tunnels	Michigan	MI			-83.4832692	42.4311464

Romulus	United States	"Off Van Born near Wayne Rd there is a warehouse complex that originally started out as Stinson Aviation. They built planes there in the 1930's. On the floor of the area are the initials of the workers who called themselves the ""Left Wing Gang"". Ironically, some of the initials are the exact same as those of workers who are there today. Legend has it that a wing fell from one of the planes and killed several workers there. After that, it was expanded and Detroit Diesel occupied it for years, where it is said a man committed suicide there. That part of the complex is now used by Ford Motor Co as a warehouse. At any time during the day and night you can hear voices and sounds as if people are working with tools like they are building something. Many times, they call out to you by your name, leaving workers to answer back to no one! Carts move all by themselves, and several of the workers have had their clothes tugged on and have been tapped on the back, only to find they are alone in the area. You can hear someone enter the toilet stall next to you, only to find no one there. Several times, workers have approached strangers, thinking they were employees, only to see them disappear into the air! Even disbelievers agree that something is going on there. Any one who visits the building will tell you they have never been anywhere like this before!"

Saugatuck	United States	The mansion was built in the 1920's by inventor Dorr Felt for his Wife Agnes. Shortly after the house's construction, Agnes, died of a stroke in her room at the mansion. Dorr Felt re-married but his new wife hated spending time at the house, most likely because Agnes was still there in spirit. The house has been a home for boys, then for nuns, and a state police post. After many, many years, the house is finally getting restored and ghost tours are giving through it to help raise money. Doors have opened and closed in Agnes's room, voices are heard, and activity shows up in pictures like orbs and mists. Many believe that Agnes and Dorr still reside in the house.

St. Clair	United States	"It is said that in the fall of the year - near Halloween - that deep in the woods to the east of Pug Road, there will be a faint glow. And if one listens carefully, you can still hear the screams echoing down through the centuries. Before the settlement of Saint Clair County, there had been a French fur trader and his family who'd set up a trading post just off the ""big river"". He chose this location because of the canoe traffic on the river. They did well in their venture until one falls in the early 1700's. While the trapper trader was up north, Indians attacked the trading post, burning it to the ground, along with the trapper's wife and children. It has to be a quiet night, preferably with moon, and if you watch and listen closely."	Pug Road	Michigan	MI	-82.48739309999999	42.8546844	-82.486024	42.8208653	Kanton St. Gallen	47.25	9.25
Saint Clair Shores	United States	located just past the Ford estate on Lakeshore drive and Marter. There have been many unexplainable events which have been witnissed first hand by the park staff in the bath house. On many ocasions the lights have turned themselves on late at nightin the office and locker room areas and and in the ladies locker room showes have turned themselves on and locker doors will open and shut on their own after the building has been locked up. In the electrical room it is said that the lights will turn them selves off on you and you can hear foot steps on the upper level of the room. On one occasion a sterio was heard playing in the office after lock up and when the closing employes went to go turn it off they found that it was not pluged in, nor did it have any batteries in it. Very late at night you can see the soda machine in the lounge area of the bath house through the glass wall facing the fenced in pool area.

Trenton	United States	A family called the Church family built the old hospital in the 1800s. It was their house until they died and their other family members didn't want anything to do with the house, so Henry Ford bought the old house and turned it into a hospital in 1944. The kids included in the family were two boys and a 9-year-old girl. The 9-year old girl loved horses so they had five horses. So, in that case, there are horse stables in the back. The little girl loved her horse and rode it everyday. Until one day, the little girl fell off the horse and broke her arm. The dad got mad and thought it was the horse's fault that his little girl broke her arm. So while she was at school one day, her dad killed the horse for hurting his little girl. The dad and his friend buried the horse on the side of their house. If you go to the side of the house where the dad and his friend buried the horse, there will be a little hill where the horse is. When the little girl came home and found out what her dad did, everyday from then on, she would come home from school, lock hers in her room, put her rocking chair in front of her window and she would sing to herself. Well, when the family died and Henry Ford bought the house, that was then the hospital, there was an old man that was in the hospital and his hospital room was what used to be the little girl's bedroom. While he was lying there in his bed, he heard singing, then he heard footsteps. When he got out of the hospital, he had someone set up thermal cameras in the room he was in and sure enough, they saw a figure in front of the window. After Henry Ford bought the hospital, six doctors wanted to build a bigger one and that's how the newer Riverside Hospital came about. They ended up closing down the old hospital 5 years ago because they found black mold growing in the building, which can kill you. They closed down the newer hospital one year ago because it was too much to keep up. Also, the Henry Ford company wanted to move everything to Wyandotte so Riverside lost business. There is a stack by the hospital. In a little tunnel thing outside of the new hospital, there is a furnace type thing. That's where they burned the amputated body parts of people. Also in that little tunnel, is the old morgue. THERE WAS A LITTLE GIRL SEEN IN THE WINDOW THAT WAS MENTIONED ABOVE. SHE WAS WEARING A WHITE DRESS WITH BROWN CURLY HAIR AND BOWS IN HER HAIR.

Walled Lake	United States	The shoe tree (previously mentioned in Salem) was on Thirteen Mile Rd. in Novi a quarter mile from Walled Lake, and from the site of the old Walled Lake amusement park. A child killer (the infamous Walled Lake Child Killer) kidnapped the children from the park, and buried their bodies in the nearby field around the tree. He threw their shoes into the tree. When the many dangling shoes were investigated, the bodies were found (but, the killer never was). If you went to the field at night, you could see and hear the clumps of tall grass moving around you, and you could hear the children cry for their mothers! Witnesses report very distinct, audible cries. The cries were not distant but, from just a few feet away. As you walked to where the cries came from, they seemed to move around. Not moving farther away, just around, sometimes back to where you were just standing. Just walking by the field would make your hair stand on end. The land was developed within the past couple of years. A subdivision now stands on this land. But, the field was on the south side of Thirteen Mile Rd., between Meadowbrook Rd., and Decker. The amusement park was later closed down. Not because of the murders but, because it rested on an old Indian burial ground (many in the area). It was where Novi Rd., 13 Mile Rd., and Southlake Dr. all meet, right on the lake.	Shoe Tree	Michigan	MI	-83.9703462	42.17038489999999	-83.4810481	42.537811	Salt Lake City	40.76078	-111.89105

Warren	United States	Located right off 13 Mile Road (Chicago RD) and Ryan Road. Reports of driving at night after having stopped the car after you think you hit something. When you get out of your car to look around. There is nothing in sight. Except by the picnic tables that were located towards the center of the park at that time. Witnesses report there was a large black figure coming at them screaming. There was no way that they hit him he was at least 100 feet away. When they all got back in the car and locked the doors. One of the passengers wanted to start driving away as fast as she could. After about 10 seconds they heard someone on top of her car. Hitting it with their hands. They didn't dare get out of the car to see what it was. Then after 30 seconds the noise stopped. They looked ahead and there was a car. That was not there before this. They could only see their tail lights. Next thing they know the car just disappeared, along with the strange black figure.
