Geauga	United States	International Restaurant, above the main entrance to the park is haunted by the ghost of a former chef who killed himself with a knife while working by himself late one night at the restaurant. International Restaurant has not been opened for years, apparently for financial reasons. However, despite its inactivity, lights are still seen in the back of the restaurant late at nights after close, witnesses have seen silhouettes of some human moving about in the faint light. The silhouette is unusually tall and carries something in his hand, which we are attributing to a chef's hat and the knife he killed himself with.

More stories surface each day in this fascinating town on the southern tip of Ohio.	- Woodland Cemetery	ohio	OH	-82.650072	38.5075517	-82.6829406	38.5367471	False	True	2020/02/26	wikipedia	13.7		Morning	Unknown	Death	2020	False	ohio	Many Witnesses	Strong Evidence	Strong Evidence	Frequent Events	Rare Events	Occasional Events	Moderate daylight duration	Moderate Sightings	Moderate Sightings	Moderate Sightings	Few Incidents	Some Incidents	Frequent Paranormal Activity			Moderate Homicide Rate	Moderate Cases	High Prevalence	High Prevalence	Moderate Cases	High Prevalence	Few Reported Cases	Few Reported Cases	Moderate Air Pollution	Good Air Quality	Moderate Air Pollution	Moderate Air Pollution	Moderate Air Pollution	Moderate Air Pollution	Stable Weather Patterns	Low Precipitation Impact	Stable Weather Patterns	- Woodland Cemetery	38.5075517	-82.650072	original	Lowry (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000), John Campbell (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000)	House (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000)	Ironton (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000), Woodland Cemetery (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000), Ohio (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000)		days later (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000), each day (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000)																Lowry (Score: 0.0000), John Campbell (Score: 0.0000)	Lowry (Score: 0.4000), John Campbell (Score: 0.4000)		House (Score: 0.0000)	House (Score: 0.4000)		Ironton (Score: 0.0000), Woodland Cemetery (Score: 0.0000), Ohio (Score: 0.0000)	Ironton (Score: 0.4000), Woodland Cemetery (Score: 0.4000), Ohio (Score: 0.4000)					days later (Score: 0.0000), each day (Score: 0.0000)	days later (Score: 0.4000), each day (Score: 0.4000)																																															"[{""text"": ""Ironton"", ""label"": ""GPE"", ""start"": 0, ""end"": 7, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}, {""text"": ""Woodland Cemetery"", ""label"": ""GPE"", ""start"": 23, ""end"": 40, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}, {""text"": ""days later"", ""label"": ""DATE"", ""start"": 258, ""end"": 268, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}, {""text"": ""Lowry"", ""label"": ""PERSON"", ""start"": 299, ""end"": 304, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}, {""text"": ""House"", ""label"": ""ORG"", ""start"": 362, ""end"": 367, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}, {""text"": ""John Campbell"", ""label"": ""PERSON"", ""start"": 442, ""end"": 455, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}, {""text"": ""each day"", ""label"": ""DATE"", ""start"": 487, ""end"": 495, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}, {""text"": ""Ohio"", ""label"": ""GPE"", ""start"": 544, ""end"": 548, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}]"	[]

Kettering	United States	It is said that in one of the restrooms a boy hung himself in the late '80 and haunts the area at night. There was also a brutal murder of three small kids.

I highly advise you not to say her name in the mirror five times if you ever visit the town of Mansfield. - June 2008 Correction - No Trespassing - No one calls her Bloody Mary, just Mary Jane. The story is published in ""Haunted Ohio"". She was not burned at the stake; she lived to a ripe old age. She was a Native American medicine woman and as time went on younger generations saw her as a witch and as such she was harassed. But there are a lot of similarities between the two. She lived on land that a young farmer took care of and he looked out for her, as she was his father’s friend. She died at an old age and did put a ""curse,"" of sorts, on the farmland and the land around. There is a marker where she is supposedly buried but she is not there. There are several hills that surround the property and she is buried on one of those, no one knows which, because she wanted to always be able to see the sun set. The farmer would always chase kids off trying to ghost hunt and even shoot at them."

Mansfield	United States	Once an old prison, the Reformatory has been turned into a ghost hunting site and tourist attraction. Movies, such as the Shawshank Redemption have been filmed there. Anyway, during Halloween, the Reformatory is opened as a Haunted House and it is indeed haunted. Many, many ghosts still reside within its walls. Inside, at night, you can sometimes see the formations of the spirits. At anytime, day or night, if you go through certain parts of it, you can feel a definite chill. There is a lingering feeling of sadness and if you walk into some of the cells, you can definitely feel the spirits in there with you. There are some very dangerous vortexes you have to watch for in there. After all of the years of negative energy, they have built up into these vortexes that are capable of doing rather nasty things to you. You can hear the voices of the spirits in the hallways near the mess hall. Heed a psychic's warning- if you ever go to this place, prepare yourself and DO NOT INVOKE THESE SPIRITS!!! They are very dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.

Maumee	United States	The old orphanage has 18 buildings, 16 of which are connected by catacombs. Legend has it that children were abused and beaten and sent down to the boiler room for punishment. The orphanage has been closed down for some time now. Some explorers found a door leading to a basement of one of the buildings that was left ajar and entered. they found the tunnel that led to the boiler room with another tunnel leading out of it. Other very small rooms were attached to the tunnels, possibly for solitary confinement. It was creepy and cold spots and cool breezes were felt every once in a while. Up in one of the rooms must have been a girl's dorm, dolls and lunch boxes, books, etc. scattered over the floor, they all had very weird sensations that they were being watched. The attic of the main building is said to be the most haunted. Also reports of seeing children watching you from the windows. The whole place was vacant and abandoned at that time.- October 2004 update: this area is being renovated into housing development.

Millfield	United States	Earlier in this century, the Millfield mine in Southeast Ohio was the scene of a series of explosions. The cemetery opened the week before in Chauncey was filled in one day's time from this. On the disaster's anniversary, if you know where to stand, you can feel the ground shiver underfoot, followed by the muffled sound of hoof beats. Legend has it that the mine ponies are fleeing, terrified, from the boiling hell coming up behind them. Listen closely and you will hear them scream as the explosion and fire catches up with them, then ... silence ...

Nelsonville	United States	It was staffed for years by a group of nuns. One of them, beloved by all who met her, loved her roses; she grew the loveliest rose gardens about the hospital, and when she died in the fullness of her years, her room was filled with roses, gifts from a grieving community. To this day if you step into that administration office that used to be her quarters, you will catch a whiff of roses. The nuns used to march at night, every evening; all patient rooms had to have their doors shut before this ritual was performed. It is said that the nuns march again before a patient dies.

Norwich	United States	In 1994, a man who lived about ten miles away got in a heated argument with his mother. The man was known to be very ignitable and he stormed out of their house and booked a room at the Siesta Motel. Later that night his mother found out where he was and called him, making him even angrier. A short while after the man went to sleep, he was awaken by the sound of someone in his room. Assuming it was his mother stepping out of bounds, and enraged, he attacked the figure in the dark. When a struggle broke out, the robber accidentally killed the man. The ghost roams over the entire building, slamming doors, turning lights off, whispering vulgarities, a few reports of crying and laughter combined, taking things and putting them in odd places, and people have reported being hit by the dark haired man.

Oxford	United States	"The Adina Indian Mound - This is very easy to get to all you need is a flash light because it does require a bit of walking. This Medina Indian mound is dated back to sometime in the BC’s there is a little plaque before you get to it that tells you the dates so you can find that out if you go check it. you might feel this strong sensation of being held back. Witnesses claim to have taken pictures from the top and had strange glowing figures, and ectomist. Go to the Heuston woods campground. You don't have to pay just go straight thru. its at the end of row b just park on the road. you have to walk through a big field but if you just go straight you'll run smack into it. The Adena Indians were ""Mound Builders"" of prehistoric time date estimating from approximately 1000 B.C.-700 A.D. along with the Hopewell Indians whose appearance is estimated at approximately 400 B.C. The name came from Adena, the Chillicothe, Ohio estate of Thomas Worthington, governor of Ohio from 1814-1818.

Oxford	United States	Peabody Hall - This hall has been known to have many sightings along with the sighting of a Ms. Helen Peabody. There have been sightings mainly in just individual rooms in the dorm. There has been documentation of a girl hanging herself in room 210, and then another person hanging themselves in that same room years later.

Flash your bright lights 3 times, first you should see small flashing red lights, then see the motorcycle headlight coming down the road. The story is there was a guy and a girl whose love was forbidden so they would sneak out to see each other, the girl would take her fathers car and pull out to the end of the road and flash her lights 3 times to signal to her boyfriend to come see her, well one night she signaled him and he began down the road to see her, supposedly a young boy was riding! his bicycle in the road, the guy on the motorcycle didn’t see him until it was too late wrecked into him and they both died, (the red lights are the reflectors off the bicycle) when the girl saw this she hung herself from the barn in her yard (which is the same yard you turn around in) the barn is still there but only remains.

Point Place/Toledo	United States	A haunted rocky shore line. A young female ghost appears almost every night at sundown. She walks across the rocky shoreline barefooted in a bright white evening dress. Legend has it that her love sailed out to the lake at dusk, and she went out to look for him. He never came home. - June 2008 Update: It's a remote section of Reno Beach. To get to it, you have to park in the last lot and walk over a short bridge and go through a path in the wooded areas. On the left side of the path you'll see the refinery, and on the right is a section of rocky ledges that lead down to a flat area about 7X8ft. At times you can see the woman in white, but we've also observed a young boy (about 6 or 7 years old) who tends to follow you on the water though the woods and over the bridge. He seems friendly, and smiles so it's almost like he's trying to play with you. He stops at the waters edge by the bridge though, looking forlorn like he can't pass there.

Portsmouth	United States	830 Murray - It is said that two brothers owned this building, formerly a shoe company. They went bankrupt and the one brother jumped to his death from a window on the fifth floor. Also rumors say it could have been the elevator shaft he jumped down. His brother was so devastated having lost his brother that he, in turn, killed himself. The 2 stories circulating are he threw himself off the roof, or jumped on the tracks in front of a train, which runs right next to the building. It is rumored that you can hear screams on the 5th floor and a breeze blowing, sometimes you might even see or feel the presence of a ghost. They don't have anyone work directly on the fifth floor anymore because people will not stay. One woman working there refuses to go past the third floor. It's definitely a scary place.

Sandusky	United States	a young woman walking past CJ's Provisions in the Frontier Trail.

If you leave a sponge on the sink in the fudge area and leave to go and do something, like take your break or go outside to get something and you come back and your sponge is gone. No one else has taken it or even seen where it went to. Then when you go back, sometimes the sponge reappears in the same place that you last left and there are only 2 of you in the stand.

Sandusky	United States	"To get the story straight on Hotel Breakers (it was probably a seasonal employee making something up about Fridays) There are two known reoccurring instances of hauntings in Hotel Breakers. Hotel Breakers has now four sections all of which were built at different places in time, the oldest and still central being of the hotel is ""The Rotunda"" which is named so for its circular five floored circular structure of which live it's majority of rooms. ""The Lobby"" is a two story structure in which contain offices and old meeting rooms on the first floor of such, second floor has rooms that were once guest rooms, now employee dwellings. this is that which we are most interested in for in one of the two second floor hallways is room #169. The very room in which during the early 1900's when the park was still just a beach resort, a guest by the name of Mary hung herself in dismay (supposed to that of a lover), hung herself in her room. Since then, Employee and guest alike have had odd occurrences, disturbances, violent unseen actions, noises, problems with electronics occur. The third oldest portion of the hotel ""Breakers East"" Which in itself wasn't built until the mid 90's and is portioned into three and four floors. The occurrences in this section were sightings of ""Faceless apparitions"" in a small combination of number. All other sightings and instances are not known as re-occurring and random. The whole park is rumored to be haunted, and also rumored to have been built on a native burial ground."

Sandusky	United States	In the 1800's, the McGreen was given money as a gift. they argued among each other what they should do with it. They left the money in their wagon until the morning so they would have time to decide. When the family awoke, the money was gone. Mr. McGreen was so mad that he killed everyone and hung himself in the well. Strange things happened in the house for almost 200 years later. Doors would open by themselves. Pets refused to go into the dining room nor would plants ever live in it. Small fires would start in the fireplace on their own. Door handles would be witnessed as wiggled when no one was on the other side to do so. Shadows are seen and images are seen outside a huge picture window that looks over a river. the well is still there and nothing will grow with in a 10 feet radius of it. In 1979, the house mysteriously burned down without any indication of a cause.

Sandusky	United States	When employees walk the halls of the third floor at night, there is an uncanny feeling that they are not alone. The television in 317 will turn on and flip channels all by itself. A laundry attendant was trapped in 315 (the locks are on the inside, and the door opens to the inside, but the door would not open from the inside.) Housekeepers cleaning room 324 have seen the curtains in 312 fluttering/opening, but when the room was checked, the AC unit was off and the room was vacant. Doors slamming and footsteps can be heard when employees are up there alone, but when they call out or go to see who's there, the halls are empty.

Shadyside	United States	Several students setting up for a haunted house sponsored by the band were, making a spoof of the Blair Witch project around 1am right before Halloween. On the film there were blue orbs and you could hear lockers shutting and people talking. None of these things were happening at the time. There was also a new night janitor who was changing a fuse on the 3rd floor. She guessed as to which one it was, when she went to pull out the fuse a hand touched her on the shoulder and told her that it is the one next to her.

Springied	United States	The Stage in the auditorium is haunted by the ghosts of two children, a boy, and a girl. Before the school was built there, it was a graveyard to the children's home across the field. All of the graves were moved to not to far away, to accommodate the school, but somehow, two tombstones were lost, maybe even the graves themselves.

Stark county	United States	Fairmount Children's Home - On Route 183 heading towards Minerva, behind the Fairmount Greenhouse is an old beat down Orphanage. 3 stories off the ground and with a humongous basement that has tunnels leading all over. Going inside the house you will frequently hear voices, footsteps, see people outside while you are inside, feelings of being watched, and see shadows on walls. You just get an overall creepy feeling just by looking at the place.

Trenton	United States	There is an old cemetery on Wehr Road that is said to be haunted. Many people have driven down it at night, as it is very popular to younger kids. Once you approach the cemetery, a man, dressed in old dirty clothes will chase you away. He is said to be the old caretaker of the cemetery who was killed by a maniac with a hatchet. He now carries the hatchet and, on some nights, if you drive by you can hear the hatchet hitting a metal door on the side of the mausoleum. There are several hatchet marks on this door.

Troy	United States	The entrance to the cemetery is surrounded by nothing but woods and the entrance is barely wide enough for a car. After you drive or walk up two smaller hills, the cemetery is on the left. The latest burial in here is from the 1800's. There is one lonely tree in the middle. At night, you can hear footsteps all around you in the woods, footsteps, which sound like walking on concrete, in the top of the tree and what appears to be the shrieking of a woman who is often heard after an Owl. On some nights you can hear moaning from the far back left corner of the cemetery. Rumor is, a woman in the 1870's was raped and murdered here while visiting her grandfather’s grave.

Troy	United States	This old country road is the sight where a motorcycle accident occurred years ago. A man not wearing a helmet was killed when he veered off the road and hit a tree. On the same road about mile down there is an old roped off trail where KKK members supposedly had meetings and sometimes hangings. Driving the road at night you can sometimes see a small green glowing orb off to the side of the road in the trees.

Urbana/West Liberty	United States	Supposedly, there was a man who was building a house for his wife and children, while it was being built the wife and children died in a horrible accident, (a train hit them) and though grief stricken, the husband completed the house. the husband was so distraught, that he set fire to the house then hung himself from the giant oak in front of the house. (it is said that sometimes there is a noose still hanging there)Though the entire house was set ablaze, only the back wall fell completely burnt, the rest of the house is intact, and many strange occurrences are said to happen there. the mystery of this haunting is that, no one is allowed to approach it at all. If you are seen going anywhere near it, you will be arrested. the old tree is still there, off of Clark road, dead, but still standing with the limb he hung himself on jutting out into the road.

Vermilion	United States	There's an angel above a grave, that is haunted. Legend goes...mother killed her daughter, and then died a few years later, after the family had put angel by daughter's grave. It is said that angry spirit of mother resides in angel. Sometime after mother died, local livestock began to show up mysteriously slaughtered in cruel, sadistic manner. Blood was found on hands and mouth of angel, prompting locals to suspect the mother had possessed the angel, and was doing the vile deeds. Local officials took matters into their own hands, clipping the wings of the angels and cutting off the hands. After this, the angel was forced to remain within the cemetery, flightless and without ability to kill. Soon after, rusty streak marks developed under the angel's eyes, as though she was crying for her sins.

The graveyard is dated and worn with only few tombstones behind it with only but thirty at most stones contained. The supposed story follows that a weary and distraught wife of a civil war officer (of himself had been killed in battle) threw herself to the river of what once drew deeper than it's current form. She is seen also annually during winter months thou in flowing white gown or white soaked in blood and haggard and drenched either matter crying can be heard sometimes.

Warren	United States	"The Underground Railroad"" - All too many homes in the area that still stand from that time all have secret passages, hidden doors and any trick the Railroaders could think to build. One in specific of these devices was a tunnel that led right beneath the Mahoning River itself not but two hundred yards from the Courthouse, of which is still standing in it's own eloquence. this tunnel was of about the length of a football field and is not visible form but five feet from either entrance, and now has been fortified off for danger of collapse. Apparently that is what brought about such as is a haunting. during time of escaping slaves, the tunnel had once collapsed. the river only being one third as wide as the tunnel was long still waved threat. a collapse toward an end trapped a group of slaves who moans and screams could be heard for days. The screams can still be heard on cool autumn days."

West Chester	United States	"Screaming Bridge -  The Screaming Bridge is located on Maud-Hughes Road in Liberty Twp. The Bridge is about 25ft above the Railroad tracks and was part of the old line C.C.C. and St. Louis back in the late 1800's and at the turn of the century it became New York Central Freight around 1900. On Sunday morning Oct 24th 1909 an Freight Train was traveling northbound from Union Twp ""which is to the south"" when 2 engineers where scalded to death when the steam train boiler blew. They say to this day reports of the dead trainmen in black walk the tracks between the Screaming Bridge to Gano. The bridge is a common place for car accidents as well as suicides over the years. To this day at least 36 reported people have lost their lives on or near the bridge. Ghostly figures are commonly seen on film with 110 400 speed or 35mm b/w or color 400 speed film. Other ghostly lights and spirit energy are commonly reported on film too. The rarely seen Invisible Bridge and train may be also captured on film too. Other things not as commonly are ghostly fogs appearing on the tracks below ""even that you seen no fog on the tracks as you took the pic"" Black hooded figures are also seen. Another story is that a bus driver lost control of the bus and all the children in it died. If you are coming up the road, there is a sign that says ""school bus stop ahead."" And if you drive across the bridge, it sounds like children are screaming. Another is there was a murder near that bridge also. And if you park on the bridge, turn your car off, roll your windows down and flash your lights three times, you will see a man with an axe walking toward your car. And yet another is of a woman threw her baby off the bridge and hung herself afterwards. People go there in the middle of the night and say they hear screams."

Willoughby Hills	United States	In early 1800's, Mr. Squire was to build a castle for his wife in the country. When the gatehouse was finished, he took his wife to stay the night so she could see how life in the country was. She awoke in the middle of the night to sounds of wild animals and wandered the house, terrified. She tripped down the basement stairs and was hung on a rope from the raptors. The basement was sealed up and construction was ended. Apparently Mr. Squires was so upset over the shock of his wife's death that he never removed her body from the basement. When at the castle at night, you can hear Mrs. Squires screaming and roaming from room to room. You can also see her dimly in the room the basement used to lead off from.

Wooster	United States	"The fine dining area of the restaurant, in this former Wayne County Jail in Wooster, used to actually be the cell block. The area is located in the basement of the building. The restaurant is said to be haunted by a man who was the first, and only, person to be hung in Wayne County. He was locked up in a cell on the basement floor, but was hung on the third floor. His actions are noticed most late in the evening and early morning hours. Several restaurant managers have made comments about calls being made to the tavern (a separate building that was once used as the jail garage - now used as ""The Olde Jaol Tavern"") from the fine dining phone when there is no-one in the fine dining area.

Zaleski	United States	Near the Zaleski CCC Camp is an old railway tunnel named Moonville Tunnel. The tunnel is still there and many local kids swim there in the creek. In the 1800's during a thunderstorm the trestle or train bridge was washed out. With no other way to stop the train the signalman stood this side of the creek where the trestle had stood. On the opposite bank was just about 20 feet then the tunnel itself. On the other side of the tunnel was a turn in the track. It was near midnight so the story goes when the signalman was waving the lantern to warn of danger. He knew it was of little use because of the layout of the track and tunnel before the trestle. The train probably didn't even see his light before crashing into the ravine below. A lot of people died that night in the crash. People who live down in the area swear that they've been to the tunnel on the anniversary of the tragic disaster. They swear that you can clearly see the signalman lamp swinging it's warning and you can see the light of the oncoming train.

Bernardsville	United States	Devil's Tree - Turn onto Long Rd, (which is really short) then make a left at the end, you will come upon a highly wooded area and then it just opens up into a field. At the end of the field there is a huge hideous looking tree with a branch that extends perfectly parallel to the ground. It is said that the tree was used to hang slaves on and still has a chilling aura to it. You can see marks on the trunk from people attempting to chop it down, they say whoever tries, something bad happens to and sometimes a pickup truck will try to chase you out. In the Summer that tree is in full bloom and actually quite lovely. In the Winter or Fall however, it is creepy looking. The axe marks on the tree are from years of kids hearing the legend of the tree and what would happen if you tried to cut it down. Supposedly if you try to cut it down the devil in a black pick up truck will come and chase you away, once you drive down the road a bit the truck just vanishes. It's an Urban Legend that gets featured in Weird NJ magazine all the time. Please get permission before you visit this property, otherwise you are trespassing and could get arrested.

Cape May	United States	(formerly known as Maureen's & New International Cuisine) - this Italian restaurant harbors the ghost of a baby girl, who the owners have named Gloria. It is believed that either murder was involved or the baby girl died while in her crib. Most of the haunting activity occurs in the cupola and upper floors of this restaurant. Customers & employees have felt her presence and have heard the rustling of furniture in the upper floors. An old black-and-white photography taken about 1900, located near the entrance in the downstairs lounge, shows the ghostly image of the baby girl Gloria. What is shocking about this picture is that the baby appears to be trapped in an old column! The picture was enlarged and examined by expers and the owners and have determined that there's no way a baby could stand in that position.

Chester	United States	A farmhouse dating back to the mid-1800s, now refurbished and occupied by ClinCon Research. Haunted by young girl in a white dress. A 19-century farmer living in the house often saw the girl staring at him, and sometimes crying, through a window. His dog refused to go in the room where the girl most often appeared. Finally he locked his dog in the room, and the dog chewed and clawed his way almost all the way through the door to get out.

Lambertville	United States	"The school was built in 1854. A fire destroyed much of it in 1926, but was remodeled in 1927. According to rumor, there was another fire in 1992 which destroyed the school for good. An ""official"" closing date has not yet been found. Several have claimed that in one of the classrooms on the second floor, the black boards were covered with drawings of children crying and burning. Another local legend is that of ""Buckeye"". There are actually two versions of this story, but with the same basic back-story. There was a championship football game between Lambertville and New Hope (PA). An intense game was going on. During a normal play, one of the New Hope Buckeyes was tackled to the ground. When all the players got up, this boy was left lying still on the grass. Because of this tragedy, the parents of the New Hope students had football removed form the schools extra-curricular activities. Urban legend #1- You are to stand on the landing between the first and second floors, just inside the front doors, and say out loud ""I challenge Billy (or Buckeye, depending on who you ask) to a football game!"" Then, out of nowhere, a football is supposed to fly straight at your head, breaking your neck. Urban Legend #2- While on the football field, located somewhere further up the hill, one is supposed to say out loud ""Buckeye, I challenge you to a race!"" A wind blows in, then either a mist arises or a pair of glowing, red eyes appear at one end of the field. A voice is heard saying, ""Run to the other end of the field or die!"" It was rebuilt then abandoned in the 1950's due to zoning issues. Kids are known to commit suicide from the third story gym windows. Reports of free floating apparitions, cold spots, and sounds heard by the EVPs. Also documented in pictures taken were ectoplasm like clouds and apparitions in 3rd floor window. Also strange noises when quiet. Plans to tear this building down in the very near future.WARNING: if you go there do not park on Washington street, you can get arrested for trespassing."

Lavallette	United States	Eighty years ago, a middle aged sea captain purchased a large house on the boardwalk facing the ocean. Legend states that he bought it for his young wife, who was only eighteen at the time. A few years later, the Captain made his final voyage, never to return. His young wife was said to have spent countless nights on the widows walk, waiting for the Captain to return. One frigid January morning, exactly two years after the Captain left, her body was found frozen on the widows walk. To this day she can be seen standing on the widows walk, waiting for her beloved to return.

Madison	United States	"The Arboretum - The arboretum is said to be haunted by the ""lady in blue"" who appears near a lake in the back of the woods and trips people, appears during sunset most often, but also during the day, which is kind of unusual.  She appears filmy and no one has ever seen a face or body, just a bluish dress.  The girl who haunts Hoyt, which was an all boys dormitory back in the day, was supposed to have slept with one of the boys, discovered she was pregnant, and hung herself in the attic.  It is definitely true that the top floor has lots of weird things happening.  Witnesses have seen doors open, window shades fly up.  It is generally held that boys do not fair well on the top floor - it's been an all girls floor for quite a while. They tend to fall for no reason and break something.  A part of the underground railroad stretches underneath the campus all the way to the next town."

New Monmauth	United States	During the Revolutionary War the woods that once stood where now stands a housing sub-division, with the street name of Shelly Drive, provided cover and refuge to many troops of both sides of the American conflict. It has long been said that where the street Shelly Drive ends into a new sub-division there was a horrible battle between Patriots and British troops. So Bloody and horrific was this Battle that scores of troops from both sides were killed. One particularly poor soul was that of a boy named William Champlain who fought on the side of the Patriots but was a spy for the British. When it was discovered by Washington's troops that Champlain was a spy they did not let on to him that he was compromised. At the start of the battle it was relayed to the troops by Washington himself that Champlain should be shot from behind to let the British know that his traitorous dealings didn't deserve a bullet from the firing squad. Upon the start of the Battle Champlain moved to the front of the line to get a better shot he was heard to say, and before the first volley of shots were exchanged between side's he was dropped in his stride from a volley of shot's from five patriot's. It has long been said that the spirit of William Champlain Haunt's the sub-division in search of Washington in the hopes of finding out why he was struck down by his own troops. Being only a boy of 17 at the time of his demise and fond of the flute he has been heard many a fall night playing sad ballads and tunes in search of his mentor. So if you are walking or driving down Shelly Drive one evening and see a young lad dressed in Colonial attire don't be alarmed it is only William Champlain looking for his troops bivouac, and the reason for his betrayal.

Oak Valley	United States	"Hermit House - At the ""Dead End"" woods where Stanford and Hamilton meet, there once stood a cabin in the woods inhabited by an old white-bearded hermit. The cabin was along a wooded pathway near a small bridge backing the houses along Montclair.

Pennington	United States	Just pulling into the stone-covered parking lot on the side of the house one begins to feel a sense of foreboding. Once in the house, a sense of negative energy can be felt. Spend time in the house and you will see and sense things. Dogs and cats will run from or refuse to enter certain rooms at different times. Heavily lined drapes will blow on a windless day with the windows shut like they were fine linen on a windy day. Heavy person-less footsteps on the wooden stairs can be heard. Door-knobs will turn violently. Faint voices and moving objects and opening and closing doors on their own. Knocks on bedroom doors late at night when no one is there if you open the door. A sense of relief can be felt when pulling away from the house.

Quinton/Bridgeton	United States	The true story of Berry’s' Chapel is, Berry was a black pastor hung by the KKK. The chapel was built back in the Civil war days. It burned down in the early sixties. The grave yard was starting to get desecrated from local kids parting in the area, and skulls started appearing in trees by the main party spot.. It was then the county moved all the bodies to the graveyard surrounding the ancient oak tree near the Salem City public library. The area is blocked off now and you can't drive back there. The Chapel was just in the paper again this week (05-27-02) as they were again cleaning up the area from those lame people who feel they have to dump all their trash back there. What was always odd is how nothing would ever grow on Berry’s' grave. No grass, no weeds, no bushes, nothing.

To this date no one was charged with the abduction and murder of Johnpat.

Washington	United States	This cemetery is kind of large and extends on both sides of a small street off RT. 57 in Washington. In the smaller side of the cemetery there are 3 large headstones (possible the largest in that section). It was a husband, a wife and child, and a family friend. They were all murdered together in the family's house in the 1840's. If you read the epitaph on the headstones it mentions something about the wrath of God coming down upon those who did the murders. (the words are very warn and hard to read). This event was known as the Changewater Murders. Apparently the wrong people were caught and hung for the crime and by the time authorities figured out who really committed the murders, they were long gone. Orbs have been seen and caught on film.

District of Columbia	United States	Building 21 - This is the building where John Wilkes Booth was hung (even though he was already dead). He was hung in the attic of the building. he wasn't the only person to be hanged there. One of the companies carrying out renovations to this old building report: All of the tradesmen on the job start very early in the morning (when it's still dark outside). The carpenters there have reported hearing footsteps in the attic and they have had something follow very close behind him up the cellar stairs, close enough to him to cause him to RUN the rest of the stairs to the first floor. They were also working in two of the three rooms in the attic when they noticed what looked like a fly flying around in all three rooms. The only thing is that there were no flys in any of the rooms (the rooms are small and wide open, so a fly could not hide from site).

District of Columbia	United States	Adams Hotel - This hotel was built in 1927 on the site of the mansion of Presidential Advisor Henry Adams in the 1880's. The wife of the original mansion owner, Marian Hooper Adams, was found dead in front of the fireplace, either by illness, murder or suicide. Throughout the hotel her spirit has been seen or felt. At night, the scent of Mimosa is in the air on the eighth floor and the housekeeping closet on the 6th floor will NEVER stay locked after repeated lockings with the key by security. One reported incident by the hotel's security chief in 1997 showed that all the guest room doors opened at the same time on the 2nd floor. Marion Adams is buried in Rock Creek Cemetery with her grave covered by a large statue (by sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens) of a hooded woman. If you stand in front of this statue and look upon it, you will begin to cry. This statue has been called GRIEF. You will also notice that the chandelier of the hotel's lobby constantly sways.

Anamoose	United States	This is now a bed and breakfast, but used to be the first school house in North Dakota, in the early 1800's. It is said that at one time there was a fire started by a coal burning stove in which the Superintendent(who smoked cigars) died in along with a young school boy. When the people that turned the old school into the bed and breakfast begin tearing down things that needed repair things started happening such as objects vanishing and moaning. Lights flickering on and off and a light would turn on in the cellar that when you used the switch to turn it off it would not go off.

Fargo	United States	This building was built in 1951 as the parochial high school. There were a few strange happenings. A teacher was working late one night when she heard footsteps in the hall she looked out and saw no one. In the gymnasium an electrician was working on an air-conditioning unit that was located under the bleachers when he happened to look up and he saw a hooded figure float from one wall to another through a solid brick wall on both sides. A young lady was working at night cleaning on the third floor for two nights. And for two nights she saw a girl come out of a closed door in the hall and go right through a picture of Mary on the opposite side. For some reason all of the ghost activity has been seen around the theatre. Soon Shanley high will be torn down in November and turned into apartments.

Fargo	United States	"Trollwood is currently home to the performing arts school and has had numerous ghostly reports. It was discovered to have been the home of a pauper's cemetery and you can see the three locations where people were/are still buried. These are now marked with small stone monuments. The most common occurrences are the ghost of a lady seen dancing around a willow tree while the students are performing or music is playing. She appears blue/grey and in 19th century dress. There have also been EVPs recorded and the voice of an old farmer that used to reside there is heard telling people to get off his property. Others report the feeling of being followed, seeing people walking around that aren't there when they look again. Voices calling to them and being ""touched"" These are just a few of the reports heard."

Fargo	United States	"The Children's Museum - The entrance to a 2nd story terrace becomes unlocked by itself. There are two doors, both locked with deadbolts. One becomes unlocked repeatedly - when there is only one person with a key - and this person has not been near the door. The elevator sometimes goes up and down without anyone in it. There is a presence of not being alone - not malevolent. This house used to house a family with 10 children in the early 1900's.

Fort Yates	United States	This very old home was built around the 1950's. Richard Luger and family live on the main floor and the rooms upstairs numbers 1-6 were either rented or just for one night stays. Luger would get complaints about room #4. They always said they saw a little girl in a white gown with long curly hair standing at the foot of the bed at night. They could also hear her giggling during various hours of the day, she'd somehow move things, make something fall, or the closet door would open! Luger didn't know what to tell his guests. His grandfather had built the place, Rich didn't know of anything like this happening in the past so he couldn't explain. His daughter sleeps in that room now and her sister, who sleeps in room #6 has claimed to see that little girl run by her room and into room 4.

Encampment	United States	"There is an area between Encampment and the old mining ghost town of Battle known as Slaughterhouse Gulch. An explosion in a mine near the area killed a miner. There wasn't enough of him left to bury properly. So it was said he walked and roamed through Slaughterhouse Gulch. Dorothy Peryam and her first husband, Horace Quivey, her brother John and his wife, Eda, were camped in the area in 1918. The men were marking timber there for the Forestry Service. It was dusk and they had made their campfire. Dorothy and John were standing close to the road when they heard a hollow cough and looked up to see a man walking down the road toward them. He walked past them, not looking to the right or left, or at them. They could not hear his footsteps as he walked by. It was very peculiar in those days for a stranger to be alone in the mountains at dark without a horse or supplies. He would have approached the fire to talk. But this person acted as though they weren't there. Charles M. Scribner ran a stage line between Battle and Encampment. One of his drivers quit because on one occasion a man approached his team of six horses, walked right between them and disappeared. The horses reared and bolted and it was all the driver could do to control them. He was sure it was the ""Ghost of Slaughterhouse Gulch."""

But didn't see anything until he remember his recorder recording in the conference room. It had several unexplained clicks on it. Then about halfway through someone breathed into it. Then on the other side of the tape, a small girl yells out, ""HELLO!"" And he and another reported were the only ones in the library! One night the janitor was vacuuming and the light came on upstairs so he ran to turn it off, but when he returned the vacuum was gone and then he heard someone upstairs vacuuming and when he went up there nobody was there! - June 2008 Update / Additional information: they built the new library on the old city graveyard. A new graveyard was constructed up the hill and it was thought that all graves had been removed from the old site and were accounted for. Not quite. During construction, workers dug up several old caskets, which broke open with the bones falling out! Spooked the workers good.

Laramie	United States	In the original part of the building built in the mid 1800's, ghost are known to turn on radios, scatter items about the old class rooms, cause the phones the ring, and open windows. The original building was built on a graveyard. It is said a music teacher hung himself in newer north part. - January 2007 Additional information/Correction: The building was not built on a graveyard. What happened back in the late 1800's was that there were some vigilante killings because a gang had taken over Laramie. Some of the bodies were buried in the vicinity of the Civic Center. They were buried all over the area. The townspeople made sure to rebury the bodies elsewhere before building the School, which is now the Civic Center. There is no way the bodies are still there as there is a basement that has to be at least 10 feet below the surface. There were no known suicides in the school or civic center. A woman did die of cancer in the building back in the 1970's. There was a janitor that died in the hospital of cancer and another janitor that died in his apartment of a brain injury. A witness reports seeing shadows darting around. They have had a terrible experience of an electric door slamming furiously one night around 10pm. The power to the door was turned off at the time it occurred. They walked through some rose scented perfume one time that wouldn't move or dissipate. They have heard voices when no one was there & heard footsteps and running when no one was there. It is possible That some has to be residual haunting such as hearing a basketball game going on. also heard Indian drumming at night. Also working late and was standing next to the copy machine, which was turned off. It came on suddenly. They have had the door to their office open and heard someone come in, but when they looked, the door wasn't open and no one was there. Reports of seeing the back of a man sitting in the janitor's office one afternoon, upon investigation, no one was there. He was wearing a yellow shirt and had dark hair.

Rawlins	United States	It is said that during the building of the house, at least two men were killed in construction accidents, and in the late 1800's the youngest son of the Ferris family, Cecil, was accidentally shot and killed by an older brother who was playing with a gun. Ever since then, there has been mild poltergeist activity, strange sounds, electrical malfunctions that cannot be explained, and many apparitions including Cecil and a woman in a long flowing nightgown that appears in the kitchen area. It has been owned by many families since the Ferris', and all have reported sightings and other strange occurrences. At this time it is a bed and breakfast, where guests still report sightings and noises in the night.

Rawlins	United States	"A.K.A - The Old Pen - The ""Old Pen"", as it is affectionately called by citizens of Rawlins, was put out of use in the early 1980's. Now the Old Pen is a tourist attraction, a historical site, and the subject of many tales of paranormal activity. Members of tour groups often report hearing strange voices in cells, seeing people disappear around corners, and feeling hostile or tense presences. Employees have also reported apparitions and sounds. There was recently an investigation by a group of paranormal experts, but specifics were not revealed except in vague terms. There are several hotbeds of activity in the prison, including the showers, Death Row, the Gas Chamber, and the Hold (isolation area), and certain specific cells, including one filled with the artwork of an inmate. Only recently restored were the Chapel and women's facility, also suspected of paranormal activity. Public functions are now held in the prison, including bazaars and Halloween ""haunted house"" tours. During the bazaars, booths were set up on ground level, near the shower area. The shower area was always inexplicably cold, with a sense of malice. Many inmates were attacked in the shower area. There are also tales of an inmate being unsuccessfully hanged a first time by fellow prisoners, and having to be thrown off the rails again. there's a book called Ghosts on the Range, or something of the like, which includes a more complete set of experiences."

Rawlins	United States	There is a 2-3 acre area, including RMS, which is supposedly an Indian burial ground and passage of an old pioneer trail. Almost all of the houses in this area have reported sightings, both of Indians and old-fashioned people. A janitor at the Middle School was working one night when a short, well-dressed man approached her. She asked him his name, and he bolted. She chased after him, and as he turned a corner, she could see that he no longer had a head. All of the janitors that have worked there have similar experiences, including strange noises and moving objects.

Alexandria	United States	There is a tree in the middle of the road in Wilder where 3 witches were supposedly hung, and there is a curse on the tree to whom ever tries to cut it down, or spits on it. I have been to this place many times, and taken pictures, and many times even though it was a clear night, the pictures have come back covered in white blotches. You will find many out of the ordinary happenings on the way out to the tree. - September 2004 update /correction: It has recently been cut down and moved to the church parking lot at the top of the road. The three humps were also left off the stroy. There are three evenly spaced humps righ before the bend the tree was on. These are the graves of the witchs. the stories of destorted pictures are true though.

Asheville	United States	Back in 1914, George W. Vanderbilt died from complications from a surgery he had for appendicitis. His wife was extremely upset. So late at nights, in the Library, she would sit in front of the large marble fireplace, and talk with George. Though he was never really there. Her servants started to think she was losing her mind. To this day late at night you can still hear her voice very softly talking with George. Also, You can feel George's presence in the Billiard Room, and the 2nd floor Oak Sitting room. One of his favorite rooms in the mansion. During rainy late nights, George would sit and read. Workers report feelings of being watched, apparitions, voices, laughing, & screams. A headless orange cat has been seen by numerous visitors roaming the area between the Gardens and the Bass pond. The Pool Room is also a focal point of unexplainable events. The sound of people swimming echoes throughout the entire lower floor in the dead of night. Insane laughter can be heard coming from the drain at the bottom of the pool. It is said to be haunted by a lady in black. Employees report hearing footsteps on the second floor. Its $10 for the small tour and $50 for the full tour of the house. But be sure you stay CLOSE to the guide. Odds are, there will only be 3 or 4 people touring with you.

Asheville	United States	Potter’s Field - In the nineteen-seventies when the new Clyde Erwin High school was built just outside Asheville, the remnants of what was called the Old County Home Graveyard was dug up to make room for the new building. Numerous transients & casualties of sickness who were buried here were moved across the street and planted below unmarked wooden crosses. It's said that the restless spirits of those buried here still haunt the school, and many janitors who have worked the night shift there refuse to recount the things they've experienced while inside. Unmarked graves are said to still lie beneath the potter's field, overlooking the school.

Asheville	United States	"Abandoned Forestry Compound - There is a building in the compound which has all the windows boarded up. The downstairs consists of a long dark hallway with doors alternating on either side. In one downstairs bathroom there is a toilet filled with blood. Upstairs there is a room used by a now dead prostitute. This building is nicknamed the ""Whorehouse"" for that reason. Even when the temperature outside is 70 degrees, it barely reaches 40 degrees inside. Strange noises are heard by people who live in the Shiloh neighborhood, and lights have been seen as well.

Chapanoke	United States	The Five Bridges Ghosts - In the early 1900's a man and his wife were driving on 5 Bridges Road in the suburb of Chapanoke and they got a flat tire. He got out to change it, and when he got back in the car, she was gone. He looked around for her, and saw her hanging in a tree. Someone had hung her and he was never found. If you go out there at night, turn off the lights on your truck/car, you'll hear someone knock for a ride home. Also, it's been reported that you can see her dangling from a tree, and something will sound like footsteps walking across the top of your car.

Ashland	United States	"It is said that during some early renovation work on the Paramount Theatre, a death occurred there and the man’s ghost has forever since haunted the Paramount. In the early 1940s, four construction workers from Boyd Theater Company in Cincinnati, Ohio were working on a project inside the auditorium. It is reported that all of them had gone to lunch except one man, a guy named Joe. When the other three returned, they found Joe hanging from the curtain rigging, dead. And since then, sounds have been heard, things have gone missing, cold drafts have been felt, and some folks even claim to have seen the image of a man appear on occasion. However, he is by all means a “good ghost” - one who seems to look out for the benefit of the theatre and its occupants. When Billy Ray Cyrus was here filming his video for ""Achy Breaky Heart,"" he was told about the legend of Paramount Joe. Between breaks, Billy Ray would talk to Joe, laughing and joking with him, sometimes even asking for his help. It is customary to get 8 x 10 photographs signed by each performer that appears at the Paramount and then hang the photo on the 'Wall of Fame' in the box office. Billy Ray personally autographed large color posters to each of the female employees working here at the time - and one with a personal inscription to Paramount Joe, whom he now had a fondness for. Each lady put her poster near her desk and Joe's was hung in the box office, near all the other performers. As time passed and the walls in the box office became too full of 8x10’s signed by other performers, the executive director felt that some of the pictures and posters needed to come down. Since there were so many of Billy Ray, she asked the women to remove their posters since they were all so similar. Nobody wanted to take their personally autographed picture of Billy Ray down so they took down the one he had signed to Paramount Joe. The next day, when the ladies came to work, every single 8x10 and poster that had been hanging neatly on the walls the night before were now lined strewn on the floor, many of their glass frames shattered! It was as if someone had wiped each one off the wall. To this day, Paramount Joe’s poster still hangs in the Paramount, in a very special part of The Marquee Room, which is now the site of Paramount Joe’s Rising Star Café’. There is another story about the time two new employees wanted to investigate the basement in the Paramount and some old items that had been stored there. To reach the basement, you must go through a door that is located just inside the lounge outside the ladies restroom. This brings you to the top of the stairs. At the top of those stairs is a light switch that will light the first section of the stairwell. As you progress, there is a switch that will light each area in front of you. And, there is no partner switch. In other words, you must turn the light off at the same place you turned it on. The marketing director had offered to take the two new female employees into the basement and turned on the lights at the top of the stairs. The ladies hurried down the steps. At that moment the marketing director was called to take a phone call inside the office. He told the other two employees to wait, he would be right back. In their excitement however, they did not hear him and they continued on. Recounting the story later, it was at this point they called up to him to turn on the next light for them. As it turned out, he was on the phone longer than expected and met the ladies as they were coming back up the steps. ""Thanks for turning on the light for us,"" one of them said, ""but we can't get it to turn off."" Puzzled, he explained that he had not turned on the light for them – and in fact, could not turn on the light. The expression on their faces revealed that they were not kidding with him. They lead him back into the basement, only to be met by darkness. 'Someone' had turned the light off again as well. ""Well, thanks Joe,"" called out one of the ladies, as she shivered. In 2004, marketing director Tyson Compton was giving a tour to some high school students. As he was relating the Paramount Joe story, he realized that he was always talking about Joe, and not to him. So as he spoke to the students, he stopped and called out, “Joe, are you here? Is it ok that I tell your story?” While he swears that he then heard a seat squeak, that is not the the most chilling part of this story. Compton relates how he received a call the very next day from a psychic who lived in the area. She asked him if someone in his family or a close friend had recently died because she had gotten a message from “the other side.” He said no that he could think of no one. “Well, she said, “I’m supposed to tell you that Joe said he is here.”"	Paramount Art

Bell County	United States	"there is a small area off the main highwa called Hutch. In this small community there is a local swimming hole called ""Devil's Garden"". Before it earned this name, a small group of partying teenagers were swimming one summer night. After partying too much, one of the kids slipped and hit his head on a rock in the shallows. Not thinking straight, the other kids decided to hide the body under water, tied to a rock. The next day, the kids went to see if the night before had really happened. They arrived to find that the local authorities had already arrived and discovered the body. To their surprise, their friend had drowned and not died of the fall. They lived with their secret for over 15 years until they each started disappearing mysteriously, and the remaining two confessed and were sentenced to ten years in prison.

Benton	United States	The story goes that an old man and woman lived in a house near this cemetery and a cult was doing some funny business in a nearby barn one night. The old man did not return from checking out the strange happenings so the old woman went down to check on him and found him hung. The barn is still there. The house the old couple lived in is gone now, but a new house was trying to be built by a new couple and mysteriously fell down on the first try. When the tombstone is glowing the old man is inside the old barn waiting on the cult members who killed him to come back so he can extract his revenge.

Berea	United States	Boone Tavern Hotel - Once a part of the under ground rail road. The basement had several rooms that were used use hide runaway slaves and for other purposes. Voices can sometimes be heard, and on more than one occasion a photograph of a young African American boy was taken. He appeared to be frightened and about 12 years of age. - March 2007 Correction: Construction on the Boone Tavern Hotel began in 1908, long after the Civil War and Railroad. Berea, Ky. as a city wasn't even established until after the Civil War, and during the war Berea College (which owns Boone Tavern) was only a normal school with two buildings. Also, Boone Tavern has no basement, only a sub-basement that houses an office and laundry. The sub-basement was dug out under the building in the 1940s.

Bowling Green	United States	"Back in '96 a man was found dead in his pickup truck in the rear parking lot. The cause of death was never determined, and the vehicle was stolen. No one ever figured out who he was, or what he died of. These days when people park in the spot where his truck was, and leave their vehicle overnight, you can walk up to it and see a man in the passenger seat who looks to be dead or sleeping. Its always the same guy. When any of the guards on duty call a police officer over to remove the guy, they find the car empty. Every single time. The parking spot has an oil stain that looks like a face and has never washed off or changed over the years. The police have nicknamed him ""the sleeper"".

Bowling Green	United States	Potter Hall -  In 1977 a girl hung herself in the basement. Change has been heard dropped in soda machines but no one is there, scratching sounds of basement floor. - February 2004 Update: is now just used for the office of the register, housing has been moved down to South West Hall. Which did once have a creepy incident involving a ouija board where a wall began to crack open. Also for Potter it was in room 8 on the bottom floor that the girl hung herself -- though that is debated some believe she was murdered. - January 2006 Correction/ Update: A student that attended school with the girl has cleared a few things up on this particular haunting. She was a Very quiet but very nice girl. Though she didn’t leave a note, she had taken her own life. They report her name was Teresa nicknamed Tye-Dye. Many on campus believe it to be Penny because of several of the office workers in that area of the building said they often find pennies rolling down the hall and find them on the floor.. So if anyone happens to notice pennies rolling down the hall or hears change clanging in the vending machines, don't be afraid. Potter Hall is Tye-Dye's old stomping ground where one day back in 1978, she made the decision to exhert the only control she had over her own life.

Charlotte	United States	The original building in this location was constructed in the late 1800's, as a church. In 1903 it was rebuilt into the structure, which exists there today. The church was taken over by the city, in the 1940's or early 1950's, and renovated into a theatre. Now, almost 100 years later, you can hear people walking around in the Church/Theatre when the facility is closed. As well, a few of the employees have noted that sometimes when they are working in the sub-basement, they can hear faint singing coming from above them.

Charlotte	United States	It is said that the school is haunted by a ghost of a girl named Sadie from the 1950's. They say that she spent a lot of time at the school because her Father was a mean drunk and always beat her. One afternoon, she came home late and her Father came after her and she took off down the street. Since she felt safe at the school, she tried to go there, but while crossing the street in front of the school, she got hit by a car and died. They say since she felt safe at the school, her spirit stayed in the school. You can hear banging on the pipes and desks will rattle and bathroom stall doors will open and close by them selves. If you’re in the auditorium, you can look back to the attic window where the projector is and you can see something moving around up there. If you go by the stairs leading to the attic, you get chills on the back of your neck as if to warn you not to go up there.

Concord	United States	The middle school is a new building that has only been around since 2000-2001. The location was moved from an older building built in the early 1920's now used as a center for students who are disruptive or for other reasons cannot participate in a normal classroom environment to another building located on Gold Rush Dr. off of Neisler Rd. Teachers and other staff at the school have reported hearing footsteps in the halls at night when no one else is in the building. There are also reports of the sound of doors slamming shut when there is no possible explanation for this, although no doors have ever been seen shutting on their own.

Breathitt County	United States	"Frozen - Old Vancleave Bible Institute - Located near Frozen Creek, this was once a bible school which housed both male and female students. Due to the difficult terrain, students lived on campus. In the flood of 1939, many students and staff perished while holing up in the boiler room. (They were warned of a tornado, not flood). Little remains of the school after the flood. Buildings include a dorm, a gym and a stone chapel. It has been reported that sounds of children laughing and crying can be heard. It is also reported that heat can be felt coming from the ""punishment rooms"". You can go there and feel like you are being watched, the laughter of little kids and in the third building you can feel heat as you go up the stairs to the punishment rooms. Some have even seen red glowing eyes in the upstairs. There is also what seems to be a small chapel that has an aboveground basement that sits out in a field. The basement is filled with black mud like substance. If viewed from above it has a whirlpool design to it. Several people say that they have heard cries of young children and have even seen them. It has been said that you will see and hear terrifying things. - December 2006 Update – has been torn down."

Campbellsville	United States	"believed to be cursed. Story has it that a train robbery in Corbin had several robbers who came up the branch line through Marion County into Taylor County and stopped as far as the train line went. An old woman that many called a witch lived there. She took care of the robbers not knowing of their exploits. One day the robbers decided to leave and didn't want anyone to know of their surroundings; they threatened the old woman and decided to kill her. She warned them that if they did that she would curse them and they would come to a bad end. The men killed her and buried the $50,000 of 1860 money under her to make a scare on anyone who tried to get it. 6 of the 7 men were caught and hanged. A tunnel was built in the area where the old woman was buried. Tons and tons of rock are buried atop her body. The one robber who got away later returned to the area. He rode the train into the area. After leaving he rode the train back to return home. As the train went through Calvary crossing the Rolling Fork River, the bridge collapsed and the last of the robbers lost his life as the curse of the ""witch woman"" all came true."

As the legend goes there are extreme temperature changes in the house, also the screams can be heard at night by people that walk down the road. On some occasions people have been known to see blood drip from the rafters of the old barn. The entire property is haunted and not many people dare to cross its boundaries if you do there is no telling what could happen. It seems as though people that go across its lines have been tortured in the future as in there dreams and everyday life. it will be a life changing experience.

Corbin	United States	Located near Early Addition St. There is a certain place in the road where people passing by will experience a strong sense of fear and the feeling that they are being watched. These feelings disappear quickly after they leave this one certain spot in the road. There have been no known reports of anything terrible having happened in the past to account for this haunting. -  February 2004 update / correction: The zone of fear is mainly experienced by pedestrians. It is a road with a lot of hills and curves and while the speed limit is posted as 15 mph, many people drive as fast as they can through this area just for fun. The submitter believes there have been a few accidents in the area but they don't have the facts with them. Could be more of an urban myth than anything else. A variation they’ve heard is that the area of fear lies off the road along the railroad tracks.

Cullowhee	United States	"The Moore Building -  The Moore Building has many rumors around it regarding the haunting. The actual story is this: A young woman enrolled in the teaching program was murdered in the mid-sixties by a local resident when she refused his romantic advances. The man was caught, however, due to his mental capacity and well-respected family connections, he served only a few years at Broughton Hospital in Morganton. The 3rd floor began experiencing a haunting shortly after the girls' death. It is true that students began refusing to live on the 3rd floor due to the sounds of crying, screaming and pacing. Moore was converted to classrooms in the 1980's, yet strange things continued to happen. The man convicted of the girl's murder died in 1997, and the paranormal activity seems to have stopped, although students on the 3rd floor often report getting ""the creeps"" or feeling like they are being watched."

Denton	United States	There is an old field in the woods along this road. In this field there is a house that has been abandoned for many years. The reason the house was abandoned was because many years ago there was a murder committed in it. A man came home one day and for some reason he had gone crazy. The man shot his wife outside of the house then went upstairs and shot himself. The blood was washed up outside the house and upstairs where the man committed suicide. After the blood was cleaned up it reappeared the next day and to this day it can't be cleaned. The room upstairs in the house where the man committed suicide has been blocked off so that nobody can go in and see the horrible scene. The blood outside is still there and cannot be removed. It is said that the place is haunted to this very day by those troubled souls.

Dillsboro	United States	When Norfolk-Southern began expansion into the southwest mountains of North Carolina, it was difficult for the company to find men able to do the hard work required. Convicts were brought in to complete work on a tunnel right outside of Dillsboro. To get to the site, the men had to cross a section of the Tuckaseegee River on raft. One day, the raft flipped over in the rain-swollen river and all of the convicts died (except one) because they were chained together. The men were buried on the mountain above the tunnel. Sometimes, especially after a big rain, people report hearing chains rattling and the echoes of men splashing in water yelling for help. **Interesting fact about this tunnel** This is the same tunnel Harrison Ford walks into in the movie 'The Fugitive'.

Greensboro	United States	Hobbs House - The Hobbs House is a dorm on the campus of Guilford College, but it used to be a real home. It is said that a long time ago this home belong to the Hobbs and they had a little girl named Mary. Well, one night Mary had a slumber party in the attic (third floor) of her house. After all the girls went to bed some boys decided to play a trick on them. The boys took rocks and wrapped them in paper and then lit them on fire and proceeded to try to throw them into the attic window. The rocks made it into the attic and started a fire. All the girls made it out of the attic in time except for Mary Hobbs. By the time the fire was put out, the third floor of the home was gone and so was Mary. It is said that if you sit in a specific room in the house/dorm you will hear faucets turning on and off and a faint cry from a little girl. You can also hear footsteps going up and down the hallways while she searches for her room.

Elizabethtown	United States	"The ""Gates of Hell"" is the nickname of a cemetery at the end of St. John Road. In Elizabethtown the cemetery at the end of Saint Johns road, known as Gates of Hell, is said to be haunted. The interesting thing about this haunted place is that when traveling to the cemetery one of the last building you see is Elizabethtown’s other haunted place, Bethlehem Academy. No more than a couple of miles to the end of the road where surrounded by trees and overgrowth the cemetery contains the graves of unknown people from the 1700’s and 1800’s. The place right outside the remains of the iron and stone gate is where people go to party away from town. Many years ago while parked there at night witnesses report they watched an enormous green orb suddenly suspended right above them.

Jackson County	United States	The story is that 15 or 16 little kids got detention and were locked in the boiler room. The boiler exploded and killed the kids. Now if you go late at night then u can hear screams, sometimes you will see little kids, if you take pictures and get them developed you will see orbs and strange smoke that is in the shape of people. But when u look at the spots in person there is nothing, but in the pictures there is freaky stuff. On the walls in the boiler room there are child size handprints burned into the wall. -  November 2005 update: no screams where noted. A well-defined shadow of a little kid was seen through one of the glass doors in the school. The investigators watched this figure move from side to side of the door and then it walked toward them through the door and stood still for around 30 seconds, all of the sudden it bent down and got into like a 3 point lineman stance and then jumped toward them, they turned the lights on and there was nothing there. They placed a voice recorder in the boiler room as well and got what sounded to be a heartbeat that kept getting faster and louder and then made one loud beat and stopped. Also there was a loud moaning throughout the whole schoolhouse from the pipes but there is no heat going through the pipes so I have no clue why that would be making noise. An update to make on the school is that it was demolished last year and made into a park for the community.

Jacksonville	United States	Footsteps and screaming in the land navigation woods on the base right outside of Camp Devil Dog. Sometimes, a young girl will come out to the road. If you're female, she will stand there and play with her hair and look at the ground. But many males have said she sees them and screams. She is very beautiful, but has wide bright eyes that seem to see right behind you at all times. Some believe she is the young mistress of a military officer, hanged to death because she fell in love with him and would have told his wife. However, the loop in the noose was too wide for her slender neck and se died days later from either asphyxiation or hunger. Some others say she is a body that was found in the swamp in the back of the woods.

Jamestown	United States	AKA Lydia's Bridge - Just outside of Greensboro, there has said to have been the ghost of a beautiful young girl who has been appearing near Greensboro since 1923. She stands next to the US Highway 70 Underpass in a white evening gown and waves frantically for someone to stop and pick her up. Those hapless travelers who do are introduced to a young woman who says her name is Lydia and she always ask them to please take her to an address in High Point. She always tells them that she has spent the evening at a dance in Raleigh and is anxious to get home, having run into car trouble on the way. Just as the drivers approach the house, the girl always vanishes from their car, never opening the door and getting out.-  March 2004 additional info: There are many versions to the story but the most common one that I have heard is that Lydia was at a dance one night and was trying to get home. A car apparently hit her and now she hitches rides home from the bridge. When the person gets her to her house, she disappears. She never says anything other than her name is Lydia; she needs to get home, and her address. Another story posted on www.dawghouse.topcities.com/northcarolina.html.  Either way, she died in 1923. The road that linked High Point and Greensboro was a different road than is there now. There are train tracks that are the reason for the bridge. The bridge now is called the graffiti bridge, for obvious reasons. To the left of this bridge, about 40 ft away and hidden in massive amounts of kudzu, is where the original bridge is, and it's Lydia's bridge. There is another bridge about 2 miles away from these that is also believed to be Lydia's bridge. This one is an actual bridge that you drive over and it's over a creek. Some kids have spray painted pentagrams on it which is kind of freaky but at the same time, there is a sort of eerie presence here. One report of a group of friends in the 80’s that would venture there had two girls in this group and every time they would get close to the bridge, the girls would pass out. www.hauntednc.com says that Lydia is merely an urban legend. Which bridge is really her bridge? How did she die? Why was she walking home? Or was she in the car with her date? Where’s a newspaper article or an obituary that can prove to us that this happened? If she died at the bridge close to the graffiti bridge, one wonders who is haunting the one over the creek? Why would kids choose that bridge to paint pentagrams on?

Landis	United States	Larry the janitor was it the boiler room for the school in the 1940's, when all of a sudden the boiler blows up killing him. Now door slam shut and thing are moved. One teacher was there late at night alone cutting paper in the workroom. When he heard someone in the hall, he looked out and no one was there, again he heard it he checks the whole school and no one was there. When he came back to the workroom all his trash was gone. When teachers would work late, small children could be heard, but not seen and an old man is heard roaming the halls. Teachers were heard teaching. And in a non-personal account (heard from teacher who was there): She was designing the bulletin board when she heard ghostly footsteps in the hall. Her daughter and her were alone in the building. Her daughter chased them and when this teacher looked out in the hall, her girl was walking with her arm in the air as if grasping an adults'. But there was no one. She called her daughter back and the girl explained, she was just walking with the nice old man. Possibly the janitor. One teacher had some students there to help with a project one night. When it was time to leave, he sent the students left and right into the building to make sure no one was still inside. The students met after completing the search and began to leave when they heard running footsteps and voices coming down the stairs. Update: the haunted portion of the school is no longer open to students or teachers.

Laurinburg	United States	Just off of this road named Fox Crossing Road lies an old lumber road that winds through the woods. While it is no longer used, it was once used by logging trucks to cut timber down and haul it out. If you walk down this lumber road at nighttime, and look out into the woods, you can sometimes see a couple, dressed in 1920's style clothing. They are dancing, and the moon shines right on them. After about three seconds, they always disappear. The story is that they were a wealthy newly wed couple back in the 1920's, and they planned on building a mansion out in these woods, equipped with a giant ballroom for dancing. But they were both tragically killed just as construction of their mansion started. And now they say their spirits dance together forever, in where their ballroom would have once stood.

Lenoir	United States	In early 1900's the present preacher had caught his wife cheating on him and he couldn't deal with the grief. So that coming Saturday he decided to commit suicide, by slitting his wrists and hanging himself from the rafters, off the front pew. On Sunday morning, the congregation of the church came in to find their preacher dead.

This is supposedly happened to a numerous amount of people. Like the spirit is looking for help. THE BONE LICK PARK is a place in which is Indian related. The are buffalo and such in the park. Many believe that the noises have to do with cries of many children whom wander off into the woods surrounding the area and never return because of an evil spirit who takes lives because his was taken.

Monroe	United States	"The old Blakney House is located on Franklin St. Believed to be haunted by William Blakney, a greedy miser who has hidden his fortune somewhere in the house. There is also rumored talk about a girl, perhaps related to Blakney, who watched her parents get run over from the upstairs window. The house was first renovated and remodeled about 15 years ago to house a privately owned ""Boswell's Restaurant."" Prior to the remodeling, neighborhood kids were told not to go around the house, but that might have been just adults against trespassing. Once the restaurant opened, employees began to report strange things, such as dishes (entire cabinets full) relocated, tables being moved, and other odd anomalies. One account, involved a luncheon on the 2nd floor in one of the reserve rooms. Only two people were at the restaurant (it didn't open until lunch) and they set up elaborate place settings for the luncheon. As they went downstairs to start preparing further, loud crashes and bangs were heard from the upstairs. Using the slave staircase (it's that old), which is the only way to get up to that part of the house when it's locked, they found the entire banquet room had been ransacked. When you try to go upstairs, you get a very unsettling feeling - the feeling of ""I don't want to go up there at all.""

Helton	United States	shaker village - the previous entry about the village at Pleasant Hill was entirely wrong.  The Shaker village is reportedly haunted, by many various spirits; however the idea that the Shakers drown babies is hideously wrong.  The shakers loved and cherished all the children in their community.  There are many stories of hauntings and I encourage everyone to visit this special place and find out the story of the shakers who lived there and may very well be there still.	Beechfork Elementary School-  This Old school was closed down last year, Because it became in such bad need of repairs, It was no big thing at first, All the equipment was removed, And the students were moved to a new school some 15 miles away, But after a while lights begin to be seen late at night, While there is no power at all in the old school, And if you stop on the Highway that runs close by it, You can still here the voices of students, And teachers, And some times late at night especial if its raining, A lone figure of a man can be seen walking the school grounds, They say it is the ghost of the man that donated the land for the school, They say that he is very unhappy that his school has been closed down, And that all of the children are gone, And if you don't move on soon, He will begin to walk toward you car, With a wicked look on his face, He wants to make sure that nothing happens to his school, After all he loved kids, hats why he gave the land for a school in the first place, Harrodsbu	kentucky	KY			-83.39073909999999	36.9539781	False	True	1961/02/26	wikipedia	13.333333333333334	11.5	Afternoon	Unknown	Death	1961	True																																		City of Pleasant Hill	41.57253	-93.48689	description	shaker village (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000)		Shaker (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000)	Shakers (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000)					Pleasant Hill (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000)												shaker village (Score: 0.0000)	shaker village (Score: 0.4000)					Shaker (Score: 0.0000)	Shaker (Score: 0.4000)		Shakers (Score: 0.0000)	Shakers (Score: 0.4000)														Pleasant Hill (Score: 0.0000)	Pleasant Hill (Score: 0.4000)																																			"[{""text"": ""shaker village"", ""label"": ""PERSON"", ""start"": 0, ""end"": 14, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}, {""text"": ""Pleasant Hill"", ""label"": ""FAC"", ""start"": 57, ""end"": 70, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}, {""text"": ""Shaker"", ""label"": ""GPE"", ""start"": 96, ""end"": 102, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}, {""text"": ""Shakers"", ""label"": ""LOC"", ""start"": 185, ""end"": 192, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}]"	[]
Hi Hat	United States	Its a spot thru the years that a lot have people have visited over the years, so it is untelling what has happened there. Anyway if you visit this cemetery late at night like 1 or 2 something will sound like it is running beside the old church banging very hard on the walls. Sometimes this unseen force that will rock your whole vehicle will slam your whole vehicle. It has a weird feeling like your being watched, and you can see things that cant be there.

The house is now used as the Alumni House for gatherings and functions. At times locked doors are unable to be unlocked. Mysterious footsteps on the second floor where the bedrooms are and the toilet on the second floor flushing by itself.

New Bern	United States	Oliver House - 1700's home in historic downtown New Bern is said to be inhabited by more than just housekeepers and tourist. A young child and her father died in the attic while being quarantined for small pox. She still can be heard playing with the toys in the attic. They eventually closed off the area from tourist after certain encounters seen by a local tour guide, Lisabeth Ballenger, assigned to the attic area, was said to have been pushed by the ghost's father. He is said to be very protective and it is apparent that he wants no one near the attic. Many others have witnessed the hauntings as well.

Pisgah	United States	Located 1 mile past Zooland Campground on Pisgah Covered Bridge Road outside of Asheboro. (.5 mile past Forest Hills) There is an old farmland there with a number of hauntings have reported over the years. The farm is made up of about 18 acres with several farmhouses scattered throughout. A little girl's voice is heard deep in the forest. A boy who hung himself there haunts the upper farm. An old lady and her husband haunt one of the houses. Her brother died in the woods near the house and can now be heard singing at night while he makes moonshine. A shadow of a black horse is seen running through the woods and then vanishes.

Lexington	United States	This historical building was once used as a house. A teenager named Gretta lived in it. It is now a restaurant, but employees always warn people about the blue room. It was Gretta's when she lived there. One night she hung herself in her room because a guy had stood her up or turned her down for a date. Visitors claim in the blue room (her room) and every so often the lights and candles would flicker and you'd feel a cold breeze go across your legs, even though there were no vents. A few other people also noticed it too.

Rural Hall	United States	The Rural Hall Fire Department was originated back in the late 1930's. Its current location is said to be haunted by one of the original Fire Chiefs. The current building as it stands was an addition remodel of one of the original buildings.

Swannanoa	United States	Several locations on campus are haunted , Bannerman computer lab, the chapel, the old well on suicide ridge (although the name has nothing to do with an actual death), and one of the teacher houses on the right side of the chapel (you'd know it by the weird tree out front) are all haunted.

Thurmond	United States	This is located one Hwy 21 North headed towards Sparta. At the base of the Mountain turn left and go up this road. About a 1/2 mile or so turn around. After you have turn around stop the car. Feel free to turn it off if you dare! Your car will start to roll and actually roll up the hill to the stop sign. Sometimes it will go beyond the stop sign but most of the time it will stop on the hill.  Story has it that many years ago a mother was going to town to get some things. She had her three kids with her and the car stalled. She had to get up over the hill to get the car to run (Jump start I suppose) as she had the boys to get out and push it up the hill the oldest slipped and fell. As he did the other two couldn't keep the car going up the hill and the car backed back down and killed the all. Where they died is where the car stops on the hill.

Madisonville	United States	There is a statue of an Angel in the Grapevine Cemetery and it is said that her eyes turn red and bleed and she cries for all the dead babies.There are two different versions of the story to the angel of grapevine cemetery. One is that at midnight on a full moon she will look up at you and her eyes will leak blood. My friends mother said she saw that about twenty years ago, the story of my generation goes as all my friends grew up within minutes of the cemetery, that her head has been broken off and sits atop her body and her right wing is broken off and laying in the ground. It is said that if you knock of her head that she will curse you with bad luck and you might die, however if you place her wing on her then she will give you one wish. There is another story of a grave there, I don't know which one but that you pull up in front of it and roll down all your windows open your trunk and doors and turn a love song up loud, because some guy committed suicide after his girlfriend left him, the ghost of a young teenager will scream a death roar and you have to get the trunk closed along with the doors and roll up the windows before he gets to your car or you will die.

Marion	United States	"Many different things occur at this particular cemetery. It is located off of Baker Church Road going toward Morganfield. You turn to the left off Baker Church Road on to Baker Hollow Road. There is one cemetery behind the church on the left. After you pass this church there is a fork in the road, follow it to the left and this is where everything begins. However on a good night it begins when you first turn on the road. You have to go after dark but the best time to go is around or after midnight. This cemetery disappears and then reappears in different locations. However it will not show itself when you drive down the road. You have to drive down to the end of the road and turn around and come back in order to see the cemetery. You will know when you are close to the cemetery because you will have an overwhelming feeling of sadness and will begin to cry for no apparent reason. You will see and hear various things. Sometimes you can hear music playing, laughter, screams and hear things trying to get in your vehicle. There have also been fingerprints and dents in vehicles visitors have taken `ut there as well as scratches that came from the outside but went all the way thought the glass. If you are actually lucky enough to find the cemetery and drive up in to it you will not be able to drive out. It is so spiritually active that it drains the battery of your car leaving you stranded until the morning or until you get brave enough to push your car out. There have been images of Soldiers killing each other and those around them. There have been sightings of the dense woods opening where you can see more than you should. The fork in the road rolls and a dense mist appears and disappears as you drive the road. There is also a guardian dog. This dog closely resembles the ""Hounds of Hell"" as described in the Bible. This dog has dead yellow eyes and casts the shadow of a demon when it gets ready to disappear in the triangle at the fork in the road. The dog appears to be injured when it first appears on the side of the road, thus making you want to stop and pick it up, which in turn gives an open invitation to any spirit that is around. When you fail to pick up the dog things begin to change. The dog will walk a few steps and then turn to see if you are still following it. However if you speed up the dog will speed up, if you slow down it will slow down, if you go to the left it will go to the left, if you go to the right it will go to the right and it is impossible to run over this dog. There have also been sightings of wrecked vehicles with people screaming for help. Due to the period in time when this cemetery was began you will see images of men who were hung from the trees out this road before and after you pass the cemetery. You will also see images of dead family members calling to you. You will also experience a change in the weather when you turn out this road. For instance it will be raining before you turn on the road, but when you turn on to this road the rain mysteriously stops and the mist begins until you exit this road where the rain will start again. There are many other things that occur out this road but you have to be very alert and very open to the spirit world and you cannot show fear or it can take your soul, according to the legend. There are many trapped souls at this location that will mess with you. Make sure you do not have an open invitation of any kind. This means windows rolled up and doors locked. These spirits can also communicate with you through your dreams if you will let them. So go if you dare just don't show fear! Everyone sees something different when they go to this location so be prepared to be scared."

Marion	United States	"Witches Grave - This cemetery is located off of Ford's Ferry Road in Marion. The legend behind this cemetery is about a five year old girl who was burned at the stake, along with her mother, in the late 1800's to the early 1900's for witchcraft. It is not known what happened to the body of the mother, however the little girl, Mary Evelyn, is buried in a steel lined grave that is covered with rock and not dirt. She has a white picket fence surrounding her grave. The base of this fence is a series of crosses that connect end to end. However she is not tall enough to climb over the fence, unlike a normal 5 year old. Her tombstone looks brand new even though it is close to 100 years old, as does the fence. She paces inside this fence when someone comes to visit her making faces at them and reaching out to them. She sleeps during the day but is very evident at night. The legend also says that she can not rest because she is searching for her mother but can not escape the confines of the fence. Many unexplainable things occur at this cemetery. For one the ""Watcher"" makes himself very know and tries to follow you out of the cemetery. The ""Watcher"" was murdered at the swinging bridge but haunts the witch’s grave. He is trying to get to the little witch but because of the crosses that surround her he is unable to because he is evil. Crosses appear in the trees both upright and upside down, directly over her grave, though they face different directions. She presents herself as a normal 5-year-old little girl in a white dress, though her dress is scorched at the bottom as is her blonde hair. If you lay on her grave she will hold you down refusing to let go until someone from outside of the fence pulls you free. However never lay on the grave when you are alone because chances are you will be pulled into her grave to be with her thus giving her more power. As with every haunted cemetery people that are open to the spirit world sees something different."

Wilkesboro	United States	"The Old Wilkes Jail Museum is seeped with interesting history. Tom Dula (better known as Tom Dooley in the south) was kept here when accused of murdering Laura Foster. The building is located just a few feet from the Robert Cleveland Log Home. The old jail is said to be haunted by many spirits.

Olive Hill	United States	Two things are rumored to happen there. One legend is never pass the old church on a Saturday night when it is drizzling. They say a woman is walking on the side of the road and if you pick her up she will disappear after a few miles. If you don't pick her up she will welcome herself into your backseat. The other one is to go to the church on Friday the 13th and look into the windows the locals say you will see the scariest thing in your life.

Owensboro	United States	In 1896 when the school was first built, it was made mostly of farmer's daughters because the boys never went to school. In 1899 the school was destroyed by a small tremor from the fault in Missouri. Two girls died when the school fell to the ground. In 1901 they rebuilt the school but over top of the old school (because it was so small) they built an art building. Still today the art building is haunted by the two girls who at night have been known to mess up the art room and when morning comes the room is a mess.

Owenton	United States	Here there is a pre civil war plantation that burnt down and killed 2 kids and there nanny. It was rebuilt and later turned into a private country club in 1967. The house was made into the restaurant and the rooms upstairs were rented out (to live in) then redone into a bed and breakfast (just for members guests). If you listen hard you can always hear little kids screaming and running footsteps all around. Doors won’t unlock and open or sometimes they won’t open even if unlocked. The nanny keeps quiet but every once in a while someone will get the privilege to see her full body in big windows that start at your nose. Since then the country club has been turned into a resort where they have built a hotel and made the golf course public. The ghosts do not like this, the fire alarms go off in the middle of the night for no reason and even after being reset will go off again. Curtains shut themselves and in the kitchen pots and pans will bang together and the doors will shut and lock themselves. The lights have dimmers and at night employees have said after turning off the switch and the lights on high they will come in the next morning and the lights will be switched on and on low dim. This doesn’t just happen at a certain time it happens ALL the time.

Paducah	United States	In the little-kids playground, through the gates, you will be talking and back around the corner you can hear the sound of a bike being slammed up against the gates, but when you walk back there, it stops. There are also voices and footsteps in the halls, especially in the hallway that has the names of the past principals listed. Also, for two miles around it, almost all of the houses have had paranormal activity. No one knows the identity of the school's ghosts, but most of the ghosts in the community are either past owners or past owners' pets. Also, the place used to be a gravel pit. According to myth, many people died on construction of the town, and, to keep people from knowing that some people had died unexplained deaths, there buried them under the town. Of coarse, that's just a myth...

Paducah	United States	A restored mansion, now a rest area, and open to the public. A female apparition has occasionally been sighted on the balcony attached to the second floor bedroom, believed to be the owner's wife. Legend has it she bled to death during an appendectomy. The feeling in that room is very pleasant, however, due to how much she loved that room---her husband had the room and balcony added on especially for her. She has been known to turn off the lights in that room, and the sounds of long skirts swishing as well as the scent of her perfume have been noted.

Park City	United States	A spirit of the cave is a Southern lady named Melissa, who brought her Yankee lover to the cave in 1843. She took the man deep within the cave to Purgatory Point and left him there as a prank. The man was never seen again, and Melissa's ghost still searches the area known as Echo River. The ghost of Floyd Collins, who died after being trapped for sixteen days in nearby Crystal Cave, is also said to wander the grounds. The case became so popular that in 1926, Collins's body was removed from his family plot and displayed in a glass coffin at the entrance to Crystal Cave. The grisly tourist attraction proved very profitable, until someone stole the corpse. It was finally returned to the cave; however, for some reason the body was missing its left leg. In recent years, tourists have reported the unidentified ghost of a man dressed in an old-fashioned cummerbund. Others have witnessed a disembodied pair of legs running down the hill near the main visitors' center. The legs were wearing denim overalls and work shoes. With over 150 sightings of ghosts reported.

It wasn’t pro or anything but it was fun for the guys mostly and their girlfriends would come to watch then race and one time there was a horrible accident and a car wrecked and went into the bleachers and killed more than 15 people and it is believed that the screams are from all the people that died that day. the track is still up there and the guard rails and what’s left of the bleachers is their too. the old buildings that the cars where sometimes kept in are still their too. Kids go up there and use it for paint ball games. People who live behind the area have experienced their roll up shades moving own their own, hearing voices whispering like at night. - June 2008 correction / additional information: The racetrack was known as Lonnie's Speedway and yes it's still there, not in good shape but still there. There was an accident that only the drivers were killed in, not 15 people. Every now and then, no certain time, you can sit on the blacktop road that runs beside the earth walls of the track and hear the wreck happen. There are no homes behind the track, it's all woods. There are houses on the creek past the track, as well as before you get to the track. If you want to find this track I'll tell you how. You go up Lewis Creek, off of US HWY 119 in Partridge. Cross the new state bridge just off 119, then go on up the holler. You'll cross a set of railroad tracks on your way to the track. You will come to a yard with a fairly large house off in the distance and an old barn just off the road; this is Lonnie Lewis' house, and barn. The Lonnie that lives in the house is also the Lonnie that the speedway was named after. The racetrack looks like just a hill, just off the road right past the barn on the left of the road. Make sure ask Lonnie's permission to go to the actual track because he is now old and might think that you're trying to steal something. His son also lives in a camper near the track, behind the barn.

Perry County	United States	Tunnel Hill - Tunnel Hill is located a couple of miles in the back roads of Napfor just before you get to low water bridge. Directly on top of the twin tunnels lie two cemeteries. But forget about the cemeteries for the tunnels are the sites of many bizarre occurrences. The story has it that there is a hidden chamber hidden among the manholes. It is said that the manhole will give way to the secret passage and those who have ventured into this passage have no recollection of how they got there. When walking through the tunnels all light sources will slowly drain and the further you venture into the tunnel total darkness. It is then that random light sources will appear from cracks and crevices on various places in the tunnel. Rather you go in the day or night the same will happen because most occurrences happen once you reach the middle of the tunnel. The right tunnel is much more active than the left. NEVER go alone. Beware these tunnels are still in service and actual trains still pass through each day. One such aspect of the haunting place is the ghost train, which you will actually hear and even feel beneath your feet. Faint train horns echo throughout this terrifying area. Also feel free to explore the large active cemeteries above. Rumors are there many more horrifying things that have happened and continue to happen that cannot be mentioned in this article. - July 2005 Update/Warning: This may not be a safe place to visit. There reports of people being chased out of the tunnels by something unexplained. This can lead to injury or worse.

Radcliff	United States	Until fairly recently (1999 or 2000) this place was off limits to just about everyone. It was part of Ft. Knox, only accessible from a couple of dirt roads across the street from the old US Cav. store. It’s now been opened to the public and made into a park. There are the remains of the old pump houses and tanks for when this was the main water source for Ft. Knox and Radcliff. On all of my visits (both before and after it being opened to the public) I have been plagued with the feeling of being watched. There is also a distinct aura of wrongness about the reservoir. The water is so murky that visibility is about 2ft at most.

Richmond	United States	An apparition haunts the 16th floor of Keene hall at Eastern Kentucky University. A student in his early twenties, late teens, committed suicide from the top floor of the University's dorm hall over a distraught fight with his girlfriend. Feelings of being watched, girls would wake up in the middle of the night and see a man in the room, then they would look twice then nothing was there, weird sounds. Very creepy if you're up there alone.

Richmond	United States	Madison Middle is very old, first it was a civil war hospital which many died in, then a high school now its a middle school. There is said to be a cheerleader that was raped and or murdered in the third floor girls bath room. Very scary sometime when you are in the bathroom alone you can hear weird noises. Sometimes late at night the last stall's door is shut and locked, but the next day when you look there is no one there and the door is completely open. A man was brutally murdered in room 306 in the late 1940's you can still hear sounds of his cry late at night mostly at 1:03 in the morning. - October 2007 Update: There is no proof of guy being murdered. There is a story about a girl on the third floor who was shoved by a bully and hit her head on the sink in the girls bathroom and die. There have been accounts and seen a figure on the third floor. There was one morning a student was helping the social studies teacher carry some things up to her class. It was about 6.45, 7 o'clock. When they got to the third floor and open the door they saw what looked like a young girl running down the hall. They went to investigate because no kids should have been in there at that time and found that the Girls bathroom light was on. There is also a rumor that the school used to be a hospital during the Civil war and is haunted by soldiers who died there.

Richmond	United States	"The Civil War emancipationist, Cassius M. Clay, one of his daughters, one of his sons, and a black servant, haunt the mansion. There have been sightings of Master Clay passing back and forth in front of the top middle window (the nursery), waiting for his ex-wife and children to return. -  June 2005 Update: The Curator at White Hall State Historic Site reports: It is possible that a daughter and son are at White Hall, as numerous incidents site a woman and a little boy. A baby most certainly resides in the mansion. On two separate occasions, in two different seasons, tour guides have heard a baby laughing. Another guide had a small child on her tour remark about seeing babies in the house. The story of Clay passing before the ""top middle window"" (which, incidentally is the third floor hallway, and not a nursery) is a story that the works say they never heard of or experienced at this site. It is doubtful that Cassius would have waited for his ex-wife and children, more likely they would be waiting for him, as he spent a great deal of time away from home campaigning, fighting in the Mexican War, as ambassador to Russia, and in general making a spectacle of himself. In addition to sightings of a lady (although we call her ""the lady in black,"" she is rather stylish and tends to change her clothes, the Curator’s husband has seen her in blue), music has been heard in the mansion (of the piano and music box variety) as well as footsteps. At times one can also smell candles, perfume, apple pie, bourbon and bacon."

Slade	United States	"As the story goes, about 5 years ago a man from Ohio was up in the mountains of the Red River Gorge enjoying the beauty and scenery of the mountains. As an inexperienced rock climber, he decided to take his chances anyway and go climbing for the day. For the most part, he had a pretty good day--until he decided to climb down to the tunnel (otherwise known as the Nada Tunnel). It was dark outside and he wasn't wearing any bright or distinctive colored clothing and as his luck would have it, his rope broke. Just as he was falling, a big green bus from the job corps came by and hit him as he was falling. To this day, the tunnel still glows from his presence. At 1:17am, the tunnel will glow for 13 minutes (the length of time it took him to die). Witnesses say, as he was dying he mentioned seeing ""the glow"". Now every year on October 29th, at 1:17am, the tunnel glows."

Spotsville	United States	There is a lake down in Spotsville Kentucky. Back in the 1800's It is said that a 13 year old girl had gotten pregnant. And did not want her parents to find out. So she took her baby to the lake, and drowned the baby by throwing it in the lake. Now to this day. When you drive to the lake and park on the dock, turn your car off and headlights. Have nothing on.

In a valley below the point was a place that was and had been describe as completely barren and dead. The trees, grass and even the branch of water was dry and gone.

Vine Grove	United States	In the downstairs bathroom there was a boy desperate and tired of being picked on. He untied his shoestrings and hung himself in the 2nd stall from the door.

And after night school don't stay around the school for to long cause by personal experience you will see the front door close and feel someone standing right next to you.

About five seconds after the clicking sound you can hear a sound like a bear or a large pack of dogs breathing very hard and the sound gets louder. It sounds like it is right on you ready to harm you, but you cannot see a thing. You can just feel that something is present. The whole time walking out you can still feel its presence. Sometimes it will break branches or knock over small tree, but never to be seen. It has happened in the daylight. The area has a history of weird happenings.

In the last year or so her headstone has been stolen and the shelter over her grave has been vandalized and almost torn apart. It's sad and the submitter has nearly cry every time they see it. They are looking into fixing the shelter themselves. But they cannot afford to replace her headstone, unfortunately. Upon research they have discovered that she is not the witch everyone thinks.

Williamsburg	United States	Gillespie (Johnson) Hall - CC is a small school...everyone knows everyone else (1700 students). The freshman girls dorm has had several incidences on the third floor where they see a girl who does not live there. Sometimes the girl is crying and sometimes she just stares. Other times she is there and disappears. Doors close and open, TV’s and stereos come on and off, radios and computers turn on. Padlocked doors are opened and then when you walk back by (minutes later) it will be locked. Some days it is locked and you can see lights from underneath the door leading up to the attic. It is rumored that she was a cheerleader who got pregnant by a football player and instead of leaving school (strict place here) she killed herself in the attic. She supposedly lived on the third floor in 316. One girl who lived in that room was engaged and at night she would take her ring off and put it on the desk and every morning she would wake up to find it in the garbage.

Winchester	United States	There is a former medical clinic turned museum in downtown Winchester, Kentucky that seems to be haunted. The stories range from footsteps around, and above the listener to doors opening and closing themselves, and even sightings of full body apparitions of former clinic employees. Moving cold spots, fluctuating EMF readings, various orb photos, and such are common in the building especially on the third floor. There have been several very clear EVPs caught in and around the former operating room, and in various places on the third floor of the building, as well as in the former morgue area. The voices captured seem to be that of doctor and nurses talking just before, or during a surgery, and of a man screaming, and moaning in pain. Also, at least one home video exists of heavy footsteps walking, and then running across the floor above the listeners, and of a hallway door shutting itself, opening itself, and then slamming its self shut. The most compelling evidence this video holds is of a lock on the third floor hallway door unexplainably unlatching its self right before your eyes, and the door slowly opening. These events have been witnessed for decades, and by countless numbers of people and as before stated even exists on video. The building is currently open  as a museum for historical tours Tuesday thru Friday for a small admission fee, and plans are in the works to do a half night paranormal tour for Halloween 2008.

Winchester	United States	There is a sharp curve in the road where a car accident happened, killing the passengers in the car. At midnight on a full moon, you can sit on the side of the road down from the curve and wait for the ghost of a woman to appear and walk from the curve toward your car. Witnesses say if you shut your car off, you will have a hard time starting it again and leaving before she can get to you. And if you leave your car running, the engine tries to bog down and die. So far no one has stayed long enough for the ghost to get to them.

Alma	United States	The Alma Cemetery is haunted for two reasons. One is the people who are buried there and refuse to leave. Some pictures have been taken during the night up there. (It's the best time.) The pictures were unbeleivable, there were orbs and mist figures in the pictures. Reason two is the legend of the Devil's Chair. The story is that in the 1800s a real old mean farmer owned the land that is now the cemetery. About that same time Alma was being built. Towns officials had been trying to get him to sell his land so they could use it for the new town's cemetery. But he kept refusing to sell it. One day while at his well getting water someone came up from behind him and pushed him into the well. Than about a week later the town officials come out to the farm to try and to get him to sell again. And one of them noticed a smell from the well. The sheriff said it was nothing and ordered for the well to be boarded and locked and that no one is suppose to talk about. So the farmers land became the town's cemetery. Than in the 1980s some teens decided to go out there and see if they can see the ghost of the old man. One of the teens dared another to sit on top of the closed well. The teen did as he was dared, but suddenly the group heard a sound behind them and turned to see what it was and there was nothing there. So when they turned around to see if there friend was still sitting there. But he wasn't. Thinking that it was a joke he was playing they left and figured they'd see him tomorrow. But the teen was never seen again. Over the years there have been other stories of people sitting on the Devil's Chair and never being seen again. Some people say that it's the farmer reaching through the now old rotted broken boards and getting revenge on the town that took his land away from him. People call it the Devil's Chair because the man was evil when he was alive and is still evil after death.

Alma	United States	Wabaunsee High School is the Haunted by past students and teachers. Most of the students groups are those of students who never got to graduate from the high school because they died while attending it. Teachers and even students have experienced strange things, which occur mostly on the third floor of the building. Things usually occur when someone is on the floor alone. One time the junior- senior class English teacher was alone in her classroom grading paper. Her door is right across the hall for the school’s auditorium and she noticed that the lights in auditorium were flickering on and off and there were voices coming from it. She thought that it was some students that had stayed in the building and were goofing off. So she went to check it but the door was locked, and the kept flickering. So she went to back to her classroom and got her key. As soon as she unlocked and opened the door the lights and the voices stopped. So she peaked in side but saw nothing. As she walked out she was stunned at what she saw, every single locker on the floor was wide open, even the ones that had padlocks on them. She slowly closed the auditorium door and locked it and as she was locking it all the locker doors slammed shut. She was so scared that she left the high school without locking her classroom door. Another time the same teacher was again grading papers by herself in her classroom. She suddenly heard music coming from the auditorium, so she grabbed her key went to the door unlocked it and opened it. She almost passed out at what she saw, she saw a ghostly looking lady playing an instrument. The figure was of a teacher who used to teacher band at the high school, she had died a few years ago of cancer. So when you walk the third floor hall of Wabaunsee High School alone beware of what you might encounter.

Blue Rapids	United States	Upon a hill there is a cemetery. It's unlike any other cemetery; It has no real paths leading up to it. It is an area about one half of an acre where several members of the Schroyer family were buried in the late 1800's. Today only one grave remains, the grave of Mr. Schroyer himself.

Dodge City	United States	(Now Soul Intermediate Center) - An old high school built in the 1800's. The true nature of the haunting has been lost in legend and lies, but one thing still holds true, there are ghosts in the halls in the basement of the school and the library. Several spirits reside within the school, not all of them friendly. There are several passageways that have been blocked off underground the school, legend says a young man was exploring down there after hours, knocked himself out and died shortly there after. Workers were tearing down the set. One of the tear down procedures was two or three of them would walk around the school and take down the flyers promoting the play. they descended to the lowest level where the basement hallways connect with the commons area and the library. While walking into an unlit area they heard the door to the library open and slam and then a laugh. They all sprinted towards the doors, only to find them locked with no one in sight and no one in the library.

Each one getting steeper and steeper and on the last one they actually hit the side of it crushing there car into a very compact box! True story. The town’s police had the car put up on a high wooden platform on the side of the road at the exact spot they died, to teach the rest of the towns teenagers from making the same mistake.

Hartner	United States	it is very very haunted. In the 1st floor men’s room it is always 15 to 20 degrees cooler the rest of the building and you feel as if you are being watched. In the basement there is the old morgue and you can see bloody footprints on the floor, walls and ceiling. On the 3rd floor you will here a toilet flush with no one in the bathroom and the elevator runs up and down on it's own. You can also see the ghost of Charlie Auchenba. There are a number of cold spots and areas where you feel as though you are being watched. You can also see the shadow of a person standing on the ledge in several of the rooms on 3rd floor. I would warn people about going there now cause it was sold and the guy that owns it WILL call the cops on you if you are caught trespassing. However, if you can get permission to check it out it is well worth it.

Hays	United States	"In 1867, a drummer named Ephriam Polly and his wife Elizabeth, stopped at Fort Hays. While staying there, a terrible Cholera epidemic struck the fort. It is not known what happened to Ephriam, but Elizabeth Polly stayed on at the fort tirelessly nursing sick soldiers. In the late afternoon, she would take a moment to walk to her favorite spot that was an isolated hilltop west of the fort. She would rest there and enjoy the peace and quiet. Elizabeth Polly eventually contracted Cholera and died in the fall of 1867. She was given a full military funeral and was buried at her favorite spot on the hilltop. In the 1960's, a marker was erected there that read ""The Lonely Grave."" It is very difficult to get to by vehicle and the last hundred yards must be covered by foot. The ghost of Elizabeth Polly has been seen many times over the years haunting the lonely hilltop that she had frequented so often in life."

Hays	United States	There was a story that said a girl went to a party at Swinging Bridge Park. She got drunk, and she wanted to go home. Her boyfriend offered to take her home, but she refused. She said that she would walk home. When crossing the highway, she was hit by a car and she died. One boy and his friend were biking down the old bike trail that is now shut down. The first time around, they were riding in tall grass, and they caught a glimpse of a pale girl walking in the grass right in front of them. One of the boys swerved to miss her. They turned and looked back, and saw nothing. They went around the trail once more and looked where they almost hit the girl. They didn't see anything. Where she was walking in the tall grass, no evidence was left - no footprints or broken grass. Stumped, the boys kept biking and then suddenly came to a stop. What they saw in frontof them was that same girl in the torn shirt wearing shorts sitting on a high tree branch. The branch was a flimsy branch and it's obvious it wouldn't be able to support more than about maybe 10 pounds. Yet stumped again, the boys took another trip around the trail and saw nothing.

Lawrence	United States	Haskell is a know sight for countless paranormal activity. The campus itself dates back to the 1800's when the US Government built Haskell Institute to help control the Native American population and assimilate them into mainstream America. Native American children were taken from their reservations and sent to schools like Haskell to teach them how to be white Americans. All aspects of their Native American heritage was stripped from them and they were forced to act as the Government felt appropriate. Countless reports and documents held in the National Archives office in Kansas City tell stories of children beaten and abused for using their Native tongue, or for acting out of conduct. The University of Kansas forensic labs hold several remains of children found buried throughout the Haskell Campus. Many rumors are speculated about some of the Universities buildings, which are all some of the oldest in the state of Kansas. Haskell is an amazing place for those who seek an up and close experience with the paranormal. The history and horror that this campus holds is unlike any other place in the world. So, if you are daring, ask for a key to Hiawatha Hall and see if you can stand to be alone in the building for more than one evening.

Lawrence	United States	Just south of Taminend Hall - there is a small cemetery with about 70 markers of children who died from a smallpox epidemic that plagued the city of Lawrence for a good year. When you approach the cemetery don't be afraid if you start to hear the sound of children crying. This is a common occurrence and has been the reason for several Native ceremonies to try to bring peace to these children who died here. One medicine man says that the children will only stop crying when they have been returned to their home lands.

The location was a gnarled tree at the top of flowertop and sure enough there stood a small dead tree that stood out from the rest. ""Historians"" dug up around the tree and found the diary. The woman talked about how the Indians were peaceful but the last entry out of nowhere stated. ""Indians Hostile"". It is along with the story that every settler was murdered and to this day that gnarled tree still stands. The odd thing about the tree is that it leans north and its branches point north while everything on the other side of it is dead, but the trees around it lean south and the north sides the dead or dieing branches. - **A few more points of interest about this place** It has been rumored that a cult was active in this very location back in the late 80s and early 90s and cows around the area were found dead with one thing wrong, their utters were sliced off, but not by animals because the cuts were too strait and clean. Those utters were then sacrificed by the cult on flowertop, a trail that no cow could have taken leads to the top."

The base was turned over to the local Johnson County Government in the Early 1970s and converted into a commercial airport, industrial complex and business center. Sometime in the late 1950s or early 1960s, A botched night landing in bad weather resulted in a pilot loosing his life when he missed the runway and ended up a ball of JP4 fire in the side of an aircraft hangar.

Every night after closing time when the manager is the only one left he locks himself in. He then sets about pushing tables to the back and stacking chairs after which he retires to his office for a smoke. More times then would probably be desired he comes back to find the tables pushed back out and the chairs untracked. Both put back in their original positions by unseen hands.

Park City	United States	One of the ghost was murdered back in these woods several years ago. It was by her husband who had caught her in a deep love affair. Little did he now that she was pregnant. Now her soul can't rest. So she takes it out on the kids who travel this trail. The second tale of a different ghost is a strange one. Jacob was riding his bike down the trail. This trail is a pretty easy to ride on except for one spot. We know it as deadman's curve. We'll when he got to this spot he was picking up speed so he tried to slam on the brakes. But for some reason his brakes were not working. So he road his speeding death trap down the wrong path. His front tire hit a root sticking up from the ground and it sent him flying head first into a tree. His lifeless body floated down the creek never to be seen again. Some say it was the wife who killed him.

Parsons	United States	"An explosion in the late 1980s killed two workers, a man and a woman, and closed the plant for more than two years. When work resumed in 1990, just in time for the Persian Gulf War, part of the building was closed. To prevent sympathetic detonation in case of an accident, work areas were located several hundred yards apart, connected by ramshackle, unpainted, wasp-infested wooden ramps. Inspectors, supervisors and parts managers rode old-fashioned bicycles with wire handlebar baskets between areas. They used thumb-operated bicycle bells to alert other bikers and ""pedestrians"" before crossing an intersection or entering an adjoining hallway. As production of the cluster bombs continued -- with 202 bombs tucked inside each one -- rumors spread that the workers killed by a single exploding bomblet was haunting the closed area of the plant. Only two of the employees who survived the explosion returned to the plant, but they each began to have nightmares about their former co-worker; one was being chased through the dark, wooden ramps by the woman, whose face was destroyed in the blast by flying shrapnel. The other survivor was plagued by visions of a male co-worker being vaporized from the waist up by the explosion, his legs, shielded by the thick steel work table, beginning to turn and run without its upper body. In the dreams, they kept running. Finally, one night two inspectors and a parts manager decided to explore the closed ramp. There were no lights in the area, and the workers hadn't thought to bring a flashlight. Still, they crept ahead into the dark. About 100 feet or so up the hall, the air cooled noticeably. The men walked a few feet further until, from around a bend ahead of them, they heard it: a metallic ringing. A bicycle bell rang twice in the pitch black, abandoned hall. Brrrng, brrrng! Then, after a pause, twice more: Brrrng, brrrng! The men, already nervous because of the dark and cold, fled back down the ramp to the light. After catching their breath, they agreed they had heard a bicycle bell, precisely the type bell used by the company's supervisors, inspectors, etc. for transportation in the labyrinthine plant. They agreed that the sound had come from ahead of them, not behind, and they agreed it wasn't likely anyone could have been in the ramp ahead of them with a bicycle."

Towanda	United States	It is said that this grocery used to be an orphanage and also a home for wayward woman. Truckers used to sleep in the basement of the building. This is one of the oldest buildings in Towanda. Many of the women that worked at the grocery have said to see potato chips, grocery carts moving on their own, the smell of fresh coffee, and cold air coming from no where. One lady that was closing up for the evening had put up all of the mops and brooms on hangers for the night and also checked the freezer to make sure it was closed up tight. The next morning when she opened the store the freezer door was wide open and all of the brooms and mops were lying on the floor in one little pile. Another Lady said to have something come up and touch her on her head and play with her hair. Something was always untying their aprons. Each time a person could feel the cold chill in the air and the hair rise on their arms.

Albany	United States	"In the basement there is an elevator that leads to the sub-basement. The sub-basement goes down another four floors and is nicknamed ""the dungeon"". It was said that when workers were laying the cement for the sub-basement a co-worker went mysteriously missing, his lunch and house keys were found but he wasn't. It was assumed that when laying the cement floor he must have fallen in and no one saw it happen. People who are new to the building are told about this ghost and the name given to him, ""Jason."" (for no real reason)To this day there have been many reports from people who travel down there for old documents and books. He will travel with you up the old steel elevators and you will get chills that will go all over your body. It feels like you have walked into a cold spot. And as soon as the chills start they will stop again. He will turn on the lights after they have been turned off (maybe to read so old books). He has also been known to help people look for books that they can't find. Books will mysteriously fall off of shelves and it will be the book that you were looking for. People say that they can feel him watching them work when they work down in ""the dungeon"". Many people have seen him out of the corner of their eye, but as soon as you turn your head to look at him he's gone again. He's also scared a few people enough to never want to go down there alone or again but he has never harmed anyone. He's become a part of everyday life with all of the people who work in the sub-basement."

Albany	United States	Professor Java's Coffee Sanctuary - Middle age gentlemen seen in walking past mirrors but when you turn there is no one there. Workers hear noises at night and sometimes lights come off and on. Spirit does not like to be around when there are many people but late during the night you get a strange feeling of heaviness and even hairs sticking up on your arms. A spirit of a dog can also be sometimes heard and seen. Building has gone many extensive renovations. It was once an old house, and then renovated to a hair stylist, it also has been reported by several people to have been at one time a secret illegal meth production house that was shut down. Spirit has been felt standing behind people and in some cases breathing down their necks behind them or being lightly touched or pushed. The activity stems from the basement. Some workers refuse to go down there by themselves.

Albany County	United States	GE Plastics - The site of GE in Selkirk used to be the Becker farm. It is over 300 acres. The original farm house is still intact and was occupied on and off with offices until March of 2004. There had been many stories from employees on what they had seen or heard. The story goes that Mr. Becker caught his wife having sex with one of the slaves. He took the slave and pushed him down a very narrow out of the way set of slave stairs and he died, he then took a knife and killed his wife by cutting her head off or attempting to anyway. He was so grief stricken about his wife having an affair and the fact that he killed her, he went to the basement and hung himself. When in the basement sometimes the lights will all blow out or other things will turn on and off. And when on the second floor where he supposedly killed his wife there is a strange smell, kind of like perfume. And when going up or down the slave stairs you get a strange sense of being watched or followed. There are also motion detectors and intrusion alarms. some guards say there that sometimes they will go off, when the building is completely empty. And they will go off in a strange order, sometimes near the basement and then almost immediately near the stairs. Sometimes it appears as if someone is walking through. They will check the system to see who accessed the Becker House and see that no one has.

Annandale-on-Hudson	United States	Blithewood Mansion - Students and faculty have long reported noises and poltergeist activity at the mansion. Sightings of a ghostly young girl between the ages of 8-12 have also been mentioned in the house and the surrounding gardens. The spirit is believed to be the daughter of Captain Andrew C. Zabriskie, the former owner and builder of the house. One winter their daughter either fell or jumped to her death out the window of their New York apartment and it is said she remains at the summer house because she disliked Manhattan while alive. An eerie postscript: before her death, Capt. Zabriskie commissioned a sculptor to create 4 statues of her for each 3 years of her life up to the age of 12 in the gardens; but to this day only three statues are present, along with an empty pedestal for the fourth one.

Aurora	United States	The Main Building - Wells College actually has a number of ghost stories. One of the most prevalent however, is that of the ghostly nurses. Many years ago, when a brutal influenza epidemic swept the nation, many students fell ill. The college then turned the fourth floor of the main building into an infirmary. Students who live there today will occasionally wake in the middle of the night to find a ghostly nurse standing over their beds. Some witnesses even claim that the ghost will go as far as to place a cold hand upon the student's forehead.

Baldwinsville	United States	It is a 5 mile road with no street lights or houses. It is all forest. It is said that back in the old days devil worshipers and members of the KKK used to worship up there and kill children as sacrifices...it is said that if you drive down the road at night you can see the children walking and there is also a bloody blanket. it is a very eerie feeling.- June 2005 Update/ Correction: The story of the KKK and satanic rituals is most likely false. Rumors are told that at some point in the past it was told that a man had been wrongly convicted of committing murder. Either as punishment or in holding before his punishment he was placed in a small shack at the end of Whiskey Hollow Road. Due to some mysterious circumstances the man died in that shack before his execution or during his incarceration there.

Brewster	United States	"There are several, seemingly, unrelated stories about this road which starts as Federal Hill Road in Brewster, New York and ends as Joe's Hill Road in Danbury, Connecticut. The most pronounced story is that of the Jesus Tree (cut down in the early 1990's). This tree with the image of Jesus on the crucifix was said to ""bleed"" a red substance from its trunk when they cut it down. There are twelve trees evenly spaced and equal in stature directly following where the Jesus Tree stood. These are said to be the twelve apostles. When you travel farther down the road (eastbound), you come to a very curious looking estate. this ominous looking estate is actually Morefar Golf Club. This is believed to be a cover for something else. Word of links to the Satanic church have been bantered about. The main entrance has a sign reading ""Back 'o Beyond"". Interesting welcome for a country club. Immediately following Morefar, and across the street is Farrington Pond. There have been several stories about people driving off the road, into the pond, claiming to have seen ""something"". The undifinitive story of this pond is that a young lady, on her way to a High School Prom, went off the road and into the pond. She was said to have drowned. When the moonlight hits the water, people have been known to see an image in a prom dress on top of the water, dancing - alone. In 1988, a young man named Dean, was found in his car on the side of the pond (just off the road), dead from gun shot wounds to the back of his head. The two men who were responsible were captured within a week. It is unknown whether this has anything to do with the spirit of the pond, but, if nothing else, it adds to the eeriness of the road."

Brockport	United States	Brockport -  Hartwell Hall - Hartwell Hall was the first building on the SUNY Brockport campus, originally used as the Brockport Normal School, a school for teachers. Cleaning staff over the years have claimed to experience things when they are alone in the building. One spoke of a periodic flurry of ghostly activity in the hallways on one of the upper floors when spirits change classes -- doors sounding as if they're opening and closing, faint laughter and voices in the hallways... Another staff member swore she was touched on the shoulder while cleaning a classroom, only to turn around and find no one. She also said she was cleaning one of the ballet rooms and, slipping from her stepladder and falling backwards, was caught by an unknown force and set down gently, unharmed. In the basement, where an empty pool sits, workers are sure they've heard splashing.

Bronx	United States	In the fields at the edge of this small beach town, stands an old abandoned farmhouse overlooking the water. People say that a large mansion once accompanied the farmhouse. The residents of the mansion were very wealthy and many people were jealous of them. One man went to the extreme and caught their house on fire. The entire house was destroyed, but the family was able to escape to the farmhouse in time. The police came to investigate, but feared the people of Silver Beach would move if they heard about the arson. The police simply said that there was a tragic fire and the family had died. They even went as far as to say the field could be used for children to play. The suspect was never found, and the family continued to live secretly in the farmhouse. In 1950, ten years after the fire, the suspect who set the fire returned. He murdered the entire family the night before Halloween by stabbing them to death. The next evening, a group of teenagers came to the field to hang out. The young daughter, who had been able to escape the murderer, was going crazy looking for her family. The teens watched in horror as she ran to the water and dived in. She drowned instantly, since she was unable to swim. They reported the incident to the police.

Buffalo	United States	A husband & wife who were archaeologists, went on a dig at Grand Island in the early 1970s through SUNY Buffalo.  First, they said there was a terrible vibe between the people on the team, who were normally good friends. People were making bad decisions and snapping at each other and acting completely unlike themselves. Then, when everyone sat down for lunch, they all heard growls coming from the surrounding woods. The couples were experienced with life outdoors even then and they both said it was not the growl of any animal native to western NY. The growling seemed to surround them and things rustled in the trees.  They all packed up and left. My parents told me that there are a lot of Native American spirits there, possibly a burial site.

Buffalo	United States	Located on Main Street, many of the students and staff have reported seeing several nuns on 3rd floor in old dormitories. Nuns would go and ring the church bell (its no longer functioning) but students can't hear the bell due to their hearing impairments but there are no reports of sounds but a lot of visuals. A little boy was reported to be seen on campus walking around Bosco Hall since it used to have a swimming pool and now converted into a small gym.

Camden	United States	Many years ago, a man who worked at the high school was fixing the lights in the auditorium. By some freak accident, he fell to his death. There were bloodstains on the carpet. To this day, the auditorium will become wicked cold without anybody touching the thermostat, and also lights will go on and off by themselves. Kids who have meetings in the room often complain about feeling someone hit them in the head, or someone poking them, and to come to find nothing is to be found. Once it was even said that during a play that was taking place, a man was interrupted by feeling his sneakers and socks getting wet because of some red liquid type on the floor. Come to find out that's where the man's bloodstain was. The incident was never solved and people still don't know how or what the red stuff was. Early in the morning, you can here a man screaming and a loud thump when you walk past the auditorium, to find nothing and nobody there. The death of the man was covered up, but it sounds like he is coming back and making people aware that he is there.

Camden	United States	On fourth Street is the old Charlie Harden House. Built in the mid 1800's, Charlie Harden, a wealthy man, had this house built where he later died. There have been more than a few sightings of the ghost of Mr. Harden in the ornate foyer, and on the curving stair case connecting to it. Cold spots abound in the house even though extensive work to the work house was completed. The sounds of someone walking on the long curving stairs and landing are often heard mainly in the late afternoon. Children who have lived in the house tell stories of the nocturnal knockings on bedroom doors and walls, and of the bad dreams that accompany them.

Elbridge	United States	"formerly known as Webbers Wayside Inn. The story goes, that many years ago a traveler from out of town was staying at this specific inn, on the second or third floor. The man had a heart attack and died one evening, his spirit never leaving the hotel again. People who have worked there for a time will tell you it was nothing for them to feel a cold spot, for a female to feel a touch on her body as she walked through an empty room, and on one occasion, a case of beer floating. The staff at this Inn have affectionately called this ghostly presence George.

Fort Covington	United States	This old Victorian mansion, once owned by occult writer Gerina Dunwich, is known by local residents to be haunted. In the early 20th century, a mentally disturbed woman was believed to have been locked away in one of the small attic rooms. She died there, leaving bloodied hand prints on the walls and ceiling. Several coats of primer and paint were necessary to cover the stains. The room contains a cold spot and several séances have been held there in an attempt to contact the restless spirit. Strange thumps have also been heard in the attic at night. Glowing lights have been seen moving through the cellar, and a ghostly presence has been felt by numerous people in the upstairs bedrooms.

Hauppauge	United States	The Begjaines (long dead) Have haunted this old house for over 215 years. It all started in 1778 when Mr. Begjaine was killed at fort Ticonderoga. Mrs. Begjaine moved her three kids to a mansion in Hauppauge. Shortly after the move a man with an English accent came to the front door saying he wanted to sell some hats. When Mrs. Begjaine let him in he pulled out a gun and killed the whole family. To this day the cops are still investigating the crime. Neighbors complain of strange noises and gunshots coming from the old abandoned house at night. Most of the cops go in but few have lived to come out.

Jamestown	United States	The Little Theater seems to be haunted by many ghosts. In the shoe room, where they keep all the shoes for performances, the door will slam shut and lock when a person goes in there. The temperature will also drop significantly. Other stories have been told about a male ghost in the boiler room and practice room. People have even reported seeing a man on stage late at night, often playing pranks on people by moving things to where they should not be. He has supposedly spoken to children, luring them across the stage when unattended by their parents.

Lockport	United States	There is an old house across from a bar in Lockport. It was a house that was involved in keeping slaves during the Civil War and was part of the underground railroad. There was a massacre there, where everyone was killed.

Long Island	United States	Back in 1997, there was an off-duty FDNY firefighter running track on a highschool track near his house. There were some kids who had a gun and they wanted to see what it felt like to shoot someone, so they waited in the woods until the fireman came around the northeast corner of the track, then they shot him. Both boys were arrested and convicted for killing the firefighter. Not long after, people reported seeing a glowing figure running along the track. Others have seen the body of a man laying on the track then dissappearing, all in the same spot he was shot, the northeast corner of lane 5. Most people won't go over to the northeast bleachers because they have the feeling of being watched. When visiting football teams come to visit, they and their fans refuse to sit in the visitors bleachers, as those lie on the northeastern part of the field. That part has now become mostly abandoned.

Long Island	United States	Lake Ronkonkoma has a haunted past. One legend is about a Setauket Sachem Indian who was not permitted to marry his love from another tribe. He paddled his canoe out to the middle of the lake and committed suicide via a knife to his heart. His body was recovered in another lake in Connecticut. Another is of a young beautiful Indian Princess who was not permitted to marry her pale face lover and she canoed out on the lake and was found dead by him. He in turn got into the canoe and was swept away, never to be seen again. Apparently, there has been a reported drowning each and every year due to a curse placed upon the lake. The myth is that the lake is bottomless. It rises and lowers mysteriously and is rumored to have a secret underwater Connection that stems for miles. Some of the drowning victims as well as the princess are said to still haunt the lake and It's surrounding area.

Long Island	United States	Mary's Grave - She murdered her two children and her husband. Her gravesite is a center for strange happenings. Her marker has her birth date but no death date. - December 2003 Update: There is a different variation on that story that seems to be the most heard of around there. Supposedly Mary was the daughter of a rich land owner that owned that area and formed the town there. He was a loner and built his house way out from the town. He also had a son. She had no friends and her father built her a stone club house on the property for her to play. She liked animals and wuld play with them in her stone clubhouse. Supposedly she was possessed by a spirit and started mutilating the animals on a stone table in her clubhouse. Later on she killed her father and her brother with an axe. After the some time the townspeople went to see what had happened the the land owner and found her sleeping in her fathers bed with him covered in blood. They hung her on a tree on the property. The tree is there on the side of the road. It always looks dead all year long. The burn marks from her rope are on the tree branch. Up the hill is the house. You can see a figure sitting in the window looking down on the road. Now that part of the house is supposed to be blocked off. Her stone clubhouse is on the road just a bit further up. The way it went was back in the 60's and 70's you were the big tough guy if you went up to Mary's grave and urinated on it. They say whoever did would get into a car accident on the way back swerving to avoid hitting a girl in a white dress. The gravesite has been lost or nobody really remembers where it is, but all the other things are there.

Appleton	United States	"There was a kid named ""Marky"" who worked, or was believed to work for the Mob in the late 20's. He had a screaming fit about the color purple, and has apparently been spotted by early teen's trying to pick them up (girls and guys). There have been stories in the paper about him, nevertheless he remains a ghost to the surrounding city folk because they know of him, and his past. Neighbors won't go near his old house, because he's said to still live in the basement. Every once in a while he's seen at night throwing fits, and convulsing & muttering something about the Mob bosses that he used to work for."

Beloit	United States	In the backroom of the stage where all of the costumes are kept and sometimes students gather to discuss or do homework during free time there is said to be a man who used to live on that spot where McNeel was built who haunts it. One of the worst experiences was when the Theatre teacher Ms. Franze was sleeping on the couch and when she awoke there was blood everywhere and students soon pointed out that she had an electricity plug stuck into the back of her head. The ghost also writes in the mirror hanging on the wall and slams the door. There's a chalkboard in the room on which 666 will be scratched and no one will be able to erase it and then a few days later disappear and then reappear.

Boltonville	United States	"There is a section of Jay road which goes thru a swamp. The area is always very dark and ominous. In the winter months this part is closed due to flooding and ice. The history is that apparently a woman was jogging down Jay road at some early part of the morning. A drunk driver, either didn't see her or was unable to stop in time to avoid hitting her. (If you travel this length of the road you will see there is no shoulder.)Her body was knocked into the swamp. Whether the incident was reported to the police is still under debate, however her body was never recovered. Persons who have traveled ""Seven Bridges"" have reported seeing a haze appear just outside their headlights, when your vehicle ""catches up to"" the entity it appears as a figure of a woman in a jogging outfit. She will jog down the road in front of your vehicle for about fifty feet, before she turns to face you, and you literally ""hit"" her. Some have had her vanish on their hoods while others say they have seen her head appear in their vehicles and look at the driver before disappearing. Reports also say if you go down this same length during the day vehicles(which are stopped) may not start up after being shut down. And that she is trying to stop people so that her body may be put to it's ""proper rest"". You could not mistake this pert of Jay road, on the brightest sunny summer day it's cold, dark and always extremely quiet. -  February 2004 correction: The stop sign on the corner of Seven Bridges and Jay Road appears to be bleeding. When you are far away the blood seems to be dripping, but then as you approach the stop sign it disappears. If you step out of your car and look at it, there is nothing there."

Boulder Junction	United States	Stevenson Creek is located far in the woods in which you can walk or bike to. All that is left of the building that once stood is a 40 ft stone chimney and the cement walls of the basement. The building that once stood in the 1920's was three stories high and was used as a bed and breakfast. One day, everybody who had been staying there, even the owners, disappeared and the house was abandoned. Nobody knows what happened to the people staying in that house. People who have paid a visit to this place have said that you can still see people walking into the basement, kids playing by the creek, sometimes running in the tall grass, and windy spots around people when everything else is calm.

Burlington	United States	When walking by at any time of night you get a horrible feeling of being watched and followed there used to even be some report along a small path there leads to another small cemetery where people were chased out by some mysterious things. - September 2004 update/ correction: the smaller cemetary can not be reached by a path, and can not be seen from the road, or the cemetary. There is a large field(about the size of a football field) that is owned by the cemetary. At the end of the field, there is a wooded area. To the left, it appears to be a large path/clearing. That is where the private cemetary is. It's very shady, fenced in, and surrounded by houses. There are a handful of old graves, scattered about, so if venturing there in the dark, be careful not to trip and fall. The cemetary is closed from Sunset to Sunrise. So there is no trespassing while it is closed. And be respectful of the people living in the area.

Malone	United States	Was built on a cemetery. The cemetery was also built on Indian Sacred ground. There have been sightings of Indians on the playground, and a man who actually uses the boy's bathroom. My Aunt lives behind the school and found out that not only is the school on Indian Sacred ground, but also their house is on the actual burial ground. My three cousins woke up at exactly the same time one night and saw an Indian girl standing on the deck. Also, they have heard moans from the basement. A few years after these occurrences, they put in a pool. They found human bones and Indian artifacts. Since that point, nothing has occurred at the house.

Monroe	United States	The McGarrah Stagecoach Tavern Inn (Monroe, NY) was on Ghost Hunter (SCI-FI) program, and in Ghost Investigator Volume 6 (Dark Shadows) book by Linda Zimmermann and has had many ghosts sighting. The McGarrah Stagecoach Tavern Inn began its existence sometime between 1790 and 1800 and constitutes one of the oldest buildings in Monroe, N.Y. On of the common sightings is a man with top hat, dress in a dark suit wondering the rooms upstairs. A witness attempted to confront the ghost by running after him, but as he turned the corner, the ghostly man vanished. The man is described about 5ft, dress in a dark suit style in 1800 with top hot. You could hear his footstep as he walks back and forth on the second floor. The basement is truly a frightening experience. Every time we went down stars the temperature dropped at least 15 degrees. EMF went wild, as you get closer to the fireplace. As the hairs on the back of my neck reacted to chills, you can actually feel ghostly pressure surrounding you. The sounds of Ghostly footsteps wondering around have become a common occurrence at this inn. This house is truly haunted. If anyone wishes to experience this ghostly Inn, please review below Telephone number. - The McGarrah Stagecoach Tavern Inn (Monroe, NY) (845) 783-6206 Private Tours by Appointments Only.

Newburgh	United States	"The story goes... There is a rather large building, in which is now know Plum Point condo's, in Newburgh NY that used to be a all boys Christian school. One of the nun's molested the boy & killed him then put his body in the wall and covered it up well (being there was already construction going on inside it was a good cover-up, he was just reported missing) Then about a year later strange things would happen that drove the school to shut down. For about 10 or more years now they have been trying to make it into an apartment complex because there are condo's all around it, and every time someone goes in there to work, a hand was cut off by machinery, the machinery would break for no apparent reason, etc.. And many people have said they have seen the boy. - October 2005 Correction: The above submission is the ""popular word about town"" regarding the information on our site, however, most of it is not true. Unfortunately, this same description regarding Plum Point on many websites. Probably cutting and pasting from this site. A visitor to our site reports the following: ""Before the condos went in, there was a large mansion (complete with detached servant's quarters.) It was originally constructed for a family who met an untimely death. The mansion then became a home for wayward girls for many years and eventually an orphanage of sorts, accepting children who were not only parentless, but had no where to run. This is where the rumors of the molestation occurrence sprouts from. The molestation may be true, but in all my research and hearing of rumors, I have never heard a report of anyone being buried in the walls."

A roofer almost fell to the ground after he saw a woman looking at him out of a window of the empty house. Carpenters fled when a person materialized out of a cloud in a bedroom. They wouldn't go back even to get their tools. Some motorists have tried to avoid a girl running from the mansion, then vanished.

New Hartford	United States	The school was built on an Indian burial ground. There have been sightings by one of the janiors that used to work in the school. She cleaned the auditorium routinely and often found one of the side doors locked, when it wasn't supposed to be. When she returned with the key, the door was shut and locked. One time she felt something like a person pass through here, and very soon after quit her job because of how much it frightened her. There have been rumors by teachers that there is one 'bad' ghost and one 'good' ghost, the bad one in the auditorium. The good one has been seen wandering the halls.

Chilton	United States	since opening in september of 1996, 3rd shift workers have reported unexplained phenomenon. Merchandise flying off the shelves, stereos turning on or changing channels by themselves, trails of muddy footprints that appear on clean floors, to numerous unexplained electrical problems with the security system mainly reporting movement when the store was totally empty of people. There have been reports of cold spots, mysterious mists or fogs in the building, and many cases of workers feeling that someone was standing behind them and even seeing shadows behind them and turning and no one is there. There have been a few sightings of a black human form seen walking through the store, sometimes right through displays. The store was built on an old homestead that had on it a family cemetary. They moved the bodies when they built the store, but they say that some of the older graves were unmarked and that they missed some of them, thus the haunting of the store by restless spirits.

The entire building has a heavy sort of a feeling to it, but it is the basement in particular that makes all who step down there to visit the restroom uneasy. Some librarians working there would not go down to the basement to the restroom the entire time they worked there because of the uncomfortable feeling that overwhelms visitors to the basement.

Delafield	United States	Nashotah House & Seminary - The grounds of this Episcopal seminary have been inhabited since the 1500s, and have been inhabited by a ghost since the mid-1700s. When an acolyte to the Episcopal priesthood attended this seminary, his wife had an affair with the Dean. To accommodate this affair, the woman hanged her husband; it was ruled a suicide, however. Since committing suicide is a mortal sin, the acolyte was buried in a cornfield rather than the cemetery. On her deathbed, the cheating wife confessed to her crime. The seminary wished to rightfully bury the body, so they exhumed the casket only to find that it was empty. It is said that the acolyte still haunts the grounds trying to get justice.

People would hear footsteps in the old kitchen hallways downstairs, beer bottles would mysteriously break and/or fly across the room in the basement. Bartenders would hear doors slam downstairs after the bar had closed and they were the only ones there. Once long after everyone had left, a bartender was getting ready to leave when he shouted ""ok everybody out"" jokingly knowing he had already cleared the bar of people. At that instance, a man stood up from his chair, shook out his coat and proceeded to walk to the door, where he disappeared completely. That bartender left and never worked again.

New York City	United States	"Numerous reports since the 1920s of students seen -- and recognized by students, and [former] professors years back -- known to have died in the First World War, haunting one of the former political club lounges in Shepherd Hall. Legend had it that in one particular instance, a math tutor noticed that a student's clothes seemed somewhat dated for the mid-20s and put it in his mind to inquire as to how the young man was making out financially; given it was still a wholly free college with a mostly working class student body. Only later that night did this ""absent minded professor"" wake up from sleep with a start, scaring his wife in the process [isn't that always the case?], with the recollection that the young man died in France in 1918. Apparitions dressed in 60's & 70's clothes and one ghost in particular is in grunge attire, he always appears ""sad looking"", is only seen just before or after closing hours."

Ogdensburg	United States	"It is said that the spirit of a young boy roams the halls giggling and laughing on the way. He was killed after a tragic fall. People have reported seeing a nun roam the halls along with strange noises and lights going on and off in locked upped rooms. Urban legend of a nun hanging herself is untrue. No one is sure where the little boy fits in. - ”There is, however, something definitely not right in the upper floor in the new dormitory wing. There has been cold spots in one room, strange appearances and a feeling of ""evil"" in one or two rooms. A couple of the sisters have experienced this as well as the lay students and the dormitory wing was blessed by a priest exorcist.

Genoa	United States	At night the current owner of the restaurant turns off the lights, but on some nights after she leaves and locks up, the lights turn back on. People have heard footsteps from the basement stairs, and dishes have mysteriously disappeared. The man who they assume is the spirit of the ghost used to be the owner of the restaurant, and he used to drink 8 cups of coffee a day. That is the number of cups that have been missing. He also used to watch CNN all the time, and no one was allowed to change the station on the television. When the workers walk out of the room with a certain channel on the TV, they come back only to see CNN on the screen. No one that works there watches that. If the ghost is the spirit of the old owner, his name is Kenny.

The speed limit is 45 but many go past that. Multiple car crashes and pedestrians have been killed at the intersection since it was constructed. A graveyard diagonal to the intersection has been seen to have ghosts what walk around, up and down the street, and sometimes in the middle of the road. Most appear in light shades of grey. They are of different sex and age, and always seem to be looking back and forth in all directions of the road, as to be looking out of traffic.

Ozone Park	United States	The Jewish cemetery is over a century old, and has hardly been taken care of. Though many have passed it on the A train, at Boyd ave. It has ben vandalized so often that the caretakers are forced to close it down at 4 PM. The graveyard is a group of 3 cemeteries. If you walk in it you will come across many graves with pictures of who occupies the tomb. As well as a few un-earth graves. One part is almost sectioned off, where only infants and children remain, with there tombstones almost completely sucked into the ground. The trees for some reason also grow in twisted formations that even you imagination can't muster a image. At night you feel like you are being watched. Reports of cries, talking, laugher and an ominous fog loom over the site. As well as faces and orbs appearing in pictures. And sites of gray images sitting on the tomb stones. But who says its safe during the day? At all hours you feel you are being watched. As well as many who have reported stomach pains near the location. While you walk, you feel like something is standing next to you or running past your eyes. And once in a while you get an over whelming stench, that brings tears to you eyes. Prey you don't go and vandalize the already damaged graves, who knows how much more those poor souls can take.

Oyster Bay	United States	The home was originally owned by the Townsend family. The house was used as a base for the British during the Revolutionary War. John Andre was a British Major during the war and visited often. One day Townsend's daughter overheard Andre and John Simcoe (Commander of British Forces) talking about a payment to Benedict Arnold to surrender his troops. The Townsends relayed this information to George Washington. Benedict Arnold escaped, but Andre was captured and hanged. His ghost was first reported here in the 1930s when he was seen on horseback outside a bedroom window. John Andre isn't the only ghost here. Sally Townsend, allegedly John Simcoe's lover is said to still haunt the house. Her former bedroom is always cold, even in the summer the curator wears a warm wool vest in that room! Paranormal investigators have said that whatever is in that room is not happy. In October of 1999 a volunteer was working on the property when the garden door opened and a man came out wearing a dark wool coat with brass buttons. First it was strange to see someone wearing that clothing, second the building was locked, and third the alarms were all on! In march another worker saw the same ghost materialize by the staircase. Once with the bottom half of his body missing, and then again full-figure. The ghost is believed to be Michael Conlin, an Irish immigrant who worked as a servant in the 1860's. In the upstairs of the former servants quarters moving shadows have been seen when no one else is in the house. In that same area the smell of roses has mysteriously been sensed. The spirit of a servant woman has materialized and walked into the kitchen. In that kitchen the smell of apple pie has also been present when ghosts want to make themselves known. The submitter was extremely privileged when they smelled the strong scent of cinnamon-apple on their way down the stairs near the kitchen. When they got down to the bottom of the stairs they could smell the strong scent of something like cinnamon rolls or apple pie! Another area that is said to produce some interesting smells is the front foyer. The smell of a non-existent stove has been sensed there as well as the faint smell of a smoking pipe. At one time this was the kitchen area. The former museum director Andrew Batten says he has sensed at least 5 different entities and something in Sally Townsend's room.

Ozone Park	United States	St. Anthony's Hospital - Update: Has since been torn down. - Close down in the late 1960's to early 70's this abandoned seven story building with a smokestack on the left hand side of the building, and a steel spiked fence around the perimeter of the hospital. The hospital was used for severely ill patients. At night only the first two floors were lighted up. Above the second floor is a whole different story. No Trespassing above the second floor. But you could hear noises and slamming sounds coming from the stairway that leads to the third floor and the fourth floor. I'm not to sure what it is today but it still stands today.

One night after closing time in 2002 or 2003, the bussers were folding napkins around table 9 when they heard a bloodcurdling scream coming from the basement. One of them went down to the basement and it was pitch black. She asked everyone else if they had been down there, but no one had.

Janesville	United States	Reports of a lady in White & many white figments float through the air. - June 2008 Investigation: The reports of a woman in white is easily dismissed because of the very lifelike statue that is illuminated by lights all around it. It's very scary, but definitely not a ghost. Also, the white lights throughout the cemetery are markers so that people don’t trip at night. Regardless, they are just lights. Also, people leave the covered candles by graves and create the same effect, only creepier, as they flicker in the wind sometimes. No paranormal activity.

Kohler	United States	"Walking through the back halls of the Hotel a witness came across a Gentleman standing there in a rather dirty Flannel Shirt and torn and faded corduroy pants , Thinking It was odd to see man in such attire at the American Club was really quite strange. They shrugged it off thinking he was a guest enjoying a cigar in the lower level. Bidding him a ""Good Evening"" , He was just staring there blankly at the wall with his right leg bent against the wall behind him and both hands thrust into his pockets. He just stared so blankly at the floor as though he didn't just see the witness greeting him. Well to get back to the office ,they had to pass him . After they passed him they got a really uneasy feeling... turned around and he was gone. Feeling a little stirred, they called security . And on the playback camera.

The bar was empty; He was watching TV for maybe an hour and a half in that one spot when he heard a knock at the door he got up to see who was there. Before he got to the door a large iron industrial fan directly above his chair fell from the ceiling crushing his chair. No one was at the door or anywhere near the bar when he checked.

Port Chester	United States	Late in the 1940's, senior students at the High School tortured and dragged a freshman to the clock tower as a freshman prank. Upon reaching the top of the old staircase, the young boy fell from the clock tower and landed on the concrete below. He broke his neck and died instantly. The boys responsible for the crime never confessed until they started experiencing hauntings during school. One was haunted so bad that he committed suicide a year later. The boy's ghost still haunts the clock tower today and can be seen opening the door that leads to it. Students also report that the lights flicker upon opening the door.

Poughkeepsie	United States	The ghost of former Rector, Dr. Alexander Griswold Cummings has been reported here many times since his death in the late 1940s or early 50s. While he was still living, he did not like using candles, so candles used during services were repeatedly blown out. At one point, a bat materialized in the church, then disappeared. In the 1970s, Bishop James Pike, Rector at the time, scared the ghost away from the sanctuary by bringing his dog into the church. After that, Alexander remained quiet for a while. In the 1990s, Alexander surfaced again. This time, it was because current Rector, the Rev. Michael Phillips, decided to move the Rector's office to a different location in the building. The move outraged the ghost, and for years afterwards, the old rector's office (now the library) would be freezing cold in the mornings, even during the spring. Eventually, the ghost went back into hiding. Another ghost is the spirit of an elderly lady, who died in the middle of a service sometime in the 1910s. Her ghost has been seen sitting in a pew halfway back, and many who sit halfway back in darkness in the evening and night feel a strange presence, even if there appears to be nothing there.

Maribel	United States	"An old abandoned building owned by Al Capone close to the Maribel Caves. This hotel was inflames in the 1920's, and it 'GLOWS' when the new moon is out. From the road, you can see every detail of that hotel. This hotel is surrounded by woods and across the street is also wooded. Its a three story hotel, all but abandoned, you can't get to the third floor anymore because of holes in the stairway. Third floor has reported to have cold hands applying pressure to their back. If you flash your light at a second floor window they flash back at you. In the basement, feelings of being threatened. The name ""Hotel Hell"" came from the blood on the walls and the yelling from the basement, the ring of the bell and the sound of wheels. The smell of sewer gas is still there in the bathrooms. Old books were in one of the rooms upstairs, burst into flames.- January 2004 update/correction - these caves are right below hotel hell. you will hear moaning as of creatures or monsters there. Witnesses have heard laughing, have seen a little girl in a black dress wearing no shoes on the stairs which go into the caves area. you can hear singing there day or night. near the old stables, visitors have been chased by white light which some of them have seen as a carriage drawn by white horses. also in the old stables the sounds of horses hooves have been heard. The submitter of the update has done some research into hotel hell and it may never have been owned by Al Capone. the first thing to be built there was a ""resort"" built in the 1800's which was one of those places where people went to be cleansed by the natural spring water which still runs pure and clear there today. when you walk the trails there (it's still open to the public) there is one cave door which has been partially opened due to a rockslide, spring water still runs there."

Merrill	United States	In the 1850's white lumbermen were welcomed by the Indians and their chief. Some time later his daughter Jenny, for whom the settlement was named for died. On how she died is speculation. One account says she fell in love with one of the lumberman, became pregnant and killed herself. Another is, she died during child birth. Another is she died from flu brought by the white man. The chief buried her on the hill, and cursed the ground that it would never do any white man any good. The curse is the legend. Nine people died after T.B. Scott bought the land for a home in 1884 and died unexpectedly in 1886 before the house was finished. Within a year his wife Ann died. Their son Walter went to see the architect to finish the house. He was stabbed to death by him. In 1893 it was sold to a man named Kuechle. He lost all his money on a gold mine and mortgaged the house to Tony Barsanti. Tony foreclosed and Kuechle went insane and died in an asylum. The same year Barsanti was stabbed to death in Chicago while waiting for a train to Merrill. In 1901, George Gibson bought the house and went to inspect it. He was never seen again. In 1906, Mary Fellhaber bought the property. Soon after fell ill and died. Popcorn Dan was the caretaker and died in 1912 after booking passage on the Titanic.The next caretaker Mr. Lloydsen died of alcoholism. In 1919 the widower of M. Fellhaber gave the property to the city. In 1923 the city gave it to the Sisters of the Holy Cross who have seemed to break the curse for now. Rumors of ghost sightings in the tower.

Milton	United States	In rooms 145-148 there are two ghostly figures of old teachers that are seen. They died when the school caught fire in the 60's. If you sit in any desks one of the women will walk past you and give you an evil look. You’ll feel very disoriented and uncomfortable. If you look at the chalkboard you'll see that the names of all the children these two punished are writing there. You can't erase them. Also, if you were to sit in the Auditorium that was just built, you will hear the curtains open slightly and then fall to the floor.

Milwaukee	United States	If you drive past Bell Middle School , you might see on the lawn of the school, a man walking with a black book bag. Whenever a car passes by and if the man hears the car, he'll stop, look on the side and down to the grass. Then, he'll continue walking. To recognize him, look for his dark black shirt, and his dark blue jeans. He has no shoes, or feet, just legs. He's totally bald and comes out after 9:00 usually.

Milwaukee	United States	Stritch DormsCardinal Stritch dorms used to be a place where nuns would live. In the basement of Stritch they used to keep the sickly nuns that would eventually die. Sometime after dark you can hear the nun walking around the hallways. Also in some of the rooms on 3 Center spirits will tear posters off the wall, closets will open on their own, locked doors will swing open, and random objects will be pushed off desks onto the floor. On 2 west you can hear running up and down the hall. As soon as you open your door to see who it is the running will stop. When you close your door the running will startup again.

Milwaukee	United States	Eagles Club - This building built in the late 20's was an all male athletic club. Many areas of the building are very cold even in the heat of summer. The ballroom has access to a door that leads to the dome maintenance room which also leads to the roof has many times been investigated by security after reports of someone throwing things off the roof. When investigated no one is found, when things like empty beer cups and ashtrays have been found below. The basement floor which houses access to the pool viewing porthole and also the boiler room, has a dirt floor that security doing a sweep of the building at closing time, have felt the strong urge to leave by a presence and feeling of coldness that is overwhelming, also accompanied by a strong odor of starch or bleach smell. It is said that after it was closed and reopened as a shelter, a man that ran it was abusive and very intolerable, to the young men that stayed there. His negative energy is felt and reports of his apparition and coldness in the pool area and in the boiler room. As far as his apparition is concerned, they were reported by bar staff accompanying the security during sweeps, they were most likely under the influence of alcohol at the time. A strong sense of negative energy is felt in all parts of the building. Always felt at night when the building closes. Strange noise like shuffling feet and loud bangs can be heard while sweeping the building fro people who may hideout after a show. It may be heard in one area and when looked into the noises are heard in the area that was just secured. Unexplainable feeling of negative energy exists in the building. There is also the ghost of a little girl at the Rave. A worker who worked there for a year or so, spent time in the coat check area in the basement. There are catacomb like hallways that run behind the coat check area. One night during a concert, they heard a little girl laughing coming from the rear hallway. When they got up to look, a wind blew through the room, and a feeling of dread came over them, and in an instant it was over.

Schenectady	United States	Reports of the ghost of a young girl open an upstairs door, across from our classroom, and enter beyond it. She has short, wavy hair, was dressed in a brown flowered dress that went halfway down her shins, ankle socks, and old shoes. The door is always locked, and as students always assumed it was a closet. They told the teacher. She checked the door, and as it was still locked, she used the school secretaries key to check. The closet was actually a short set of stairs which led to a singular classroom which was no longer used and unknown to the current students. The girl was not found. My father, who attended the same school as a child, told me that the old room was used to teach retarded children in his and his own father's day. It was always locked even then to prevent the children from leaving. Many students as well as some teachers had seen spirit children open or go through the locked door to the classroom at the top of the hidden stairs.

Seneca	United States	Mill Creek - There was said to be a woman that mysteriously was drowned in this creek. It was called a suicide, but the water was only 4 feet deep at the deepest spot where this woman was found. There is also a graveyard that runs along side the edge of the gorge of this creek. There have been stories of a woman ,dressed in black garments of the 1800s alongside the creek,opposite the graveyard, looking right at a person, with a sad expression on her face, and then pointing across the gorge (towards the cemetary) and then disapearing. She has been seen in various areas of this property. In addition, General Sullivan was said to have marched through this area, burning down Native Americans crops along the way, and was said to have buried his cannowith all the soldiers pay somewhere, alongside the creek. Occasionally an erie feeling will come over people when they walk through that area. - This land is privately owned, but with permission from the owners,people would likely be able to investigate.

Staten Island	United States	(Arthur Kill Rd) Specter of a young woman walks thru dining areas, and appears on stairs. - June 2008 Update/Additional Information – A former worker reports experiencing The Female ghost. She is the spirit of the woman who lived in the home. Her husband had built the farmhouse when they were married, but he was called of in the civil war. When the husband returned home, he found his wife in bed with another man. He killed both of them and buried her on the property. The building has gone through a major renovation, but the basement was pretty much a dug out stone lined pit where there were many spirits. They were all either soldiers or slaves that would use the tunnels to hide in. There would be lights shattering for no reason, cold winds piercing your skin, and at one point The worker was actually thrown into a wall and the doors leading to an area in the basement that was cross nailed shut banged as if someone was running to hide in the dark. When you go into the new building now, there is the wedding photo of the spirit who still remains in the building to this day.

Staten Island	United States	Richmond Town is located off of Amboy Road in Staten Island New York with a number of historical houses to visit. The houses range from 100-300 years old. All of the houses are known to have spirits in them. If you go there late at night, there is a specific house located on one of the side streets, which is white in color with a green cellar door on the side of the house. If you look up at the left hand window, you will without a doubt see the apparition of a little boy in the window. Two little boys were known to have died in the upper level of the house. You can go on a tour of Richmond Town during the day with the tour guides,(but it's more fun to explore at night). The up stairs in the children's house smells like a hospital, and the kitchen of the children's house still smells like the burning of the stove after a meal. If you go near the kitchen window at night, it smells like something was just cooked on the wood-burning stove. The schoolhouse in historical Richmond town is also haunted. There is also a small graveyard next to the old courthouse in Richmond Town, which has many restless spirits in it. One spirit is that of a young girl with a broken heart, who has been known to wander around at night looking for her lost love. When boys walk passed the graveyard or through Richmond Town, she sometimes mistakes them for being her long lost love.

Oshkosh	United States	During renovation work in the 1980's, workers and crew saw the ghost of Percy Keene, a stage manager who died in the 1960's. They saw his face in windows sometimes and thought it was a night watchman, but the opera house didn’t hire any night watchman. Also during the filming of a movie based on a haunted theatre, the director saw Percy's ghost in the balcony smiling down at him. Other ghosts are in the basement.

Oshkosh	United States	"The art center is a house that was built during the depression. Her and her husband were extremely wealthy, and owned most of Oshkosh. They owned the larger factories, and paid their employees with, vouchers to purchase goods at stores the couple owned. Basically keeping all the money under their tight control. When the people of Oshkosh learned of the Paine center being built, they threatened the couple that if they ever moved into it, the people of Oshkosh would kill them. The couple feared the people of Oshkosh. And never did move it. In fact NO one has ever lived in the Paine Fine Art Center. Mr. Paine did pass on first, and Mrs. Paine did out live him. She donated their house to the city, with one stipulation, no children under 18 were allowed in it. She was never able to have children, and therefore resented children. Children are allowed in the center now, but Mrs. Paine is no longer alive. It's said that you can see the woman roaming the house during tours. The couple has also been seen together ""enjoying"" the house they dreamed of living in together. Workers often say a lady at the back of the crowd will start to explain things in the house but when they look for who was talking the place the voice came from can not be found."

Once swayed, most of the girls are never seen again. He has no known residence, although it's said that he still lives in his parent's basement. If a confrontation happens then he runs like a lightning bolt, and isn't seen again. To everyone that has knowledge of him... he's a ghost!

With two other men, he built the Rock Garden Tavern in 1936, which he ultimately managed after his retirement from lumber jacking in 1949. In 1950 this self-taught sculptor began crafting his unique entourage of cowboys, miners, Indians, and soldiers. Indian. His first masterpiece was inspired by the image of a large antlered deer leaping over a log that he had noticed on a boy's sweater. He used beer bottles from his tavern to decorate the life-size concrete horde, which mostly crowds the front of the park along Hwy. 13. He built the broad-shouldered, blocky characters starting with wooden frames wrapped with mink wire, or animal skeletons.

Staten Island	United States	In Wolfe's pond park in prince's bay Staten island, if you enter the park through a path next to the prince's bay train station and follow the paths down you will come across a small 20 ft. cliff. At the bottom is a large pond. If you stand on the banks of the pond on a spot that has an upside down car in the water. At that spot in the 1970's a car with two teenagers inside mistakenly drove off that 20 ft drop and overturned. Their bodies were not found for two weeks. You are known to experience cold sensations or visions of a phantom car rolling and overturning in the lake. IN the 1970's and 80's several children were abducted, raped and murdered in these woods. Several people have reported hearing disembodied screams and crying, Some have even said they've seen little children walking on the path crying searching for their parents or possibly their killer.

Suffolk County	United States	Mary O'Leary's grave - Behind Queen of the Rosary Academy, there is a cemetery that priests and nuns were buried in.  A young novice had fallen in love with one of the grounds keepers.  She snuck out of the convent one night to meet her lover. They were going to run away and get married. Before her lover got there she was raped and murdered.  Because of the horrible way that she was murdered she could not be buried in the cemetery so they buried her where they found her body.  on the night of a full moon if you pulled up by her grave stone you could see her standing on the road side. They have since opened the road and her gravestone can no longer be found. However, when you drive a certain point of new highway, you can hear screams.

Syracuse	United States	On July 12, 1918, a munitions plant exploded at Split Rock Quarry, west of Syracuse. It took the lives of 50 men with it. 15 were never identified and buried in a common grave. More than 80 years after the plant blew up, the spirits of the dead still roam the ledges or stand on the ruined rock crusher of the old quarry. They glow in shades of green and yellow, a ghostly after-image of the effects of picric acid, the bitter, and toxic explosive that once stained miners' skin yellow-green. - August 2004 additional information: at split rock quarry in syracuse, new york it is said that there is a vortex by the munitions plant and you disappear for a half an hour and end up on the bottom of a hill...also the rock crusher that is there makes a humming noise like it is still running...in a tunnel that is behind the rock crusher there are stalagmites {i think thats what they are called} that actually still have blood on the end of them {it is supposedly blood but it looks like paint}...just thought you might like some extra information on things that happen there.

Saint Nazianz	United States	US headquarters for Catholic mystic cult which was forced to flee Germany in the 19th century because of its secret practices. Hotbed of pedophilia, closeted homosexual love triangles, suicide, fraud, incest and even an exorcism! The patron cult leader Father Oschwald is kept in a crypt on the grounds. His followers are buried in front of his crypt. Their graves are alternately sinking and rising. Oswald is known to wander the forested perimeter of the eutrophied Lake Oswald on a white horse. His followers wander the grounds moaning. The decayed buildings are known to be haunted by the screams of the tortured souls who've spent time there. In addition, they are infested with all manner of pests including many active wasp, hornet and bee hives. Much of the village was severely damaged in a freak storm in 2000. Locals uneasily murmur about the 'Wrath of Oswald' and his fury with the townsfolk who've abandoned him...

Spooner	United States	Railroad and newspaper man Frank Hammill is generally regarded as the ”Father of Spooner.” He arrived in 1883 on the Chicago Northwestern Railroad. He later became publisher of the Spooner Advocate, mayor of the town, and a prominent Republican politician. Hammill died suddenly in 1922 of a mysterious stomach problem. His body was displayed in the beautiful house he had built for himself and his family. His wife lived the remainder of her days there and often reported felling that Frank was still there with her. As time passed and new owners took over, the house gained a reputation of being haunted. Frank, said the owners, was still in “his” house, watching over “his” town. Most reported hearing noises, voices, and feeling that they simply were not alone in the old house -- one family even moved out. Today the apparent hauntings continue, and the current residents are absolutely certain they are not alone. They even refer to their “guest” as Frank.
