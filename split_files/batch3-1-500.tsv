Geauga	United States	International Restaurant, above the main entrance to the park is haunted by the ghost of a former chef who killed himself with a knife while working by himself late one night at the restaurant. International Restaurant has not been opened for years, apparently for financial reasons. However, despite its inactivity, lights are still seen in the back of the restaurant late at nights after close, witnesses have seen silhouettes of some human moving about in the faint light. The silhouette is unusually tall and carries something in his hand, which we are attributing to a chef's hat and the knife he killed himself with.

More stories surface each day in this fascinating town on the southern tip of Ohio.	- Woodland Cemetery	ohio	OH	-82.650072	38.5075517	-82.6829406	38.5367471	False	True	2020/02/26	wikipedia	13.7		Morning	Unknown	Death	2020	False	ohio	Many Witnesses	Strong Evidence	Strong Evidence	Frequent Events	Rare Events	Occasional Events	Moderate daylight duration	Moderate Sightings	Moderate Sightings	Moderate Sightings	Few Incidents	Some Incidents	Frequent Paranormal Activity			Moderate Homicide Rate	Moderate Cases	High Prevalence	High Prevalence	Moderate Cases	High Prevalence	Few Reported Cases	Few Reported Cases	Moderate Air Pollution	Good Air Quality	Moderate Air Pollution	Moderate Air Pollution	Moderate Air Pollution	Moderate Air Pollution	Stable Weather Patterns	Low Precipitation Impact	Stable Weather Patterns	- Woodland Cemetery	38.5075517	-82.650072	original	Lowry (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000), John Campbell (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000)	House (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000)	Ironton (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000), Woodland Cemetery (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000), Ohio (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000)		days later (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000), each day (SpaCy_Score: 0.0000, Rule_Score: 0.4000)																Lowry (Score: 0.0000), John Campbell (Score: 0.0000)	Lowry (Score: 0.4000), John Campbell (Score: 0.4000)		House (Score: 0.0000)	House (Score: 0.4000)		Ironton (Score: 0.0000), Woodland Cemetery (Score: 0.0000), Ohio (Score: 0.0000)	Ironton (Score: 0.4000), Woodland Cemetery (Score: 0.4000), Ohio (Score: 0.4000)					days later (Score: 0.0000), each day (Score: 0.0000)	days later (Score: 0.4000), each day (Score: 0.4000)																																															"[{""text"": ""Ironton"", ""label"": ""GPE"", ""start"": 0, ""end"": 7, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}, {""text"": ""Woodland Cemetery"", ""label"": ""GPE"", ""start"": 23, ""end"": 40, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}, {""text"": ""days later"", ""label"": ""DATE"", ""start"": 258, ""end"": 268, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}, {""text"": ""Lowry"", ""label"": ""PERSON"", ""start"": 299, ""end"": 304, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}, {""text"": ""House"", ""label"": ""ORG"", ""start"": 362, ""end"": 367, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}, {""text"": ""John Campbell"", ""label"": ""PERSON"", ""start"": 442, ""end"": 455, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}, {""text"": ""each day"", ""label"": ""DATE"", ""start"": 487, ""end"": 495, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}, {""text"": ""Ohio"", ""label"": ""GPE"", ""start"": 544, ""end"": 548, ""spacy_score"": 1e-05, ""rule_score"": 0.4}]"	[]

Kettering	United States	It is said that in one of the restrooms a boy hung himself in the late '80 and haunts the area at night. There was also a brutal murder of three small kids.

I highly advise you not to say her name in the mirror five times if you ever visit the town of Mansfield. - June 2008 Correction - No Trespassing - No one calls her Bloody Mary, just Mary Jane. The story is published in ""Haunted Ohio"". She was not burned at the stake; she lived to a ripe old age. She was a Native American medicine woman and as time went on younger generations saw her as a witch and as such she was harassed. But there are a lot of similarities between the two. She lived on land that a young farmer took care of and he looked out for her, as she was his father’s friend. She died at an old age and did put a ""curse,"" of sorts, on the farmland and the land around. There is a marker where she is supposedly buried but she is not there. There are several hills that surround the property and she is buried on one of those, no one knows which, because she wanted to always be able to see the sun set. The farmer would always chase kids off trying to ghost hunt and even shoot at them."

Mansfield	United States	Once an old prison, the Reformatory has been turned into a ghost hunting site and tourist attraction. Movies, such as the Shawshank Redemption have been filmed there. Anyway, during Halloween, the Reformatory is opened as a Haunted House and it is indeed haunted. Many, many ghosts still reside within its walls. Inside, at night, you can sometimes see the formations of the spirits. At anytime, day or night, if you go through certain parts of it, you can feel a definite chill. There is a lingering feeling of sadness and if you walk into some of the cells, you can definitely feel the spirits in there with you. There are some very dangerous vortexes you have to watch for in there. After all of the years of negative energy, they have built up into these vortexes that are capable of doing rather nasty things to you. You can hear the voices of the spirits in the hallways near the mess hall. Heed a psychic's warning- if you ever go to this place, prepare yourself and DO NOT INVOKE THESE SPIRITS!!! They are very dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.

Maumee	United States	The old orphanage has 18 buildings, 16 of which are connected by catacombs. Legend has it that children were abused and beaten and sent down to the boiler room for punishment. The orphanage has been closed down for some time now. Some explorers found a door leading to a basement of one of the buildings that was left ajar and entered. they found the tunnel that led to the boiler room with another tunnel leading out of it. Other very small rooms were attached to the tunnels, possibly for solitary confinement. It was creepy and cold spots and cool breezes were felt every once in a while. Up in one of the rooms must have been a girl's dorm, dolls and lunch boxes, books, etc. scattered over the floor, they all had very weird sensations that they were being watched. The attic of the main building is said to be the most haunted. Also reports of seeing children watching you from the windows. The whole place was vacant and abandoned at that time.- October 2004 update: this area is being renovated into housing development.

Millfield	United States	Earlier in this century, the Millfield mine in Southeast Ohio was the scene of a series of explosions. The cemetery opened the week before in Chauncey was filled in one day's time from this. On the disaster's anniversary, if you know where to stand, you can feel the ground shiver underfoot, followed by the muffled sound of hoof beats. Legend has it that the mine ponies are fleeing, terrified, from the boiling hell coming up behind them. Listen closely and you will hear them scream as the explosion and fire catches up with them, then ... silence ...

Nelsonville	United States	It was staffed for years by a group of nuns. One of them, beloved by all who met her, loved her roses; she grew the loveliest rose gardens about the hospital, and when she died in the fullness of her years, her room was filled with roses, gifts from a grieving community. To this day if you step into that administration office that used to be her quarters, you will catch a whiff of roses. The nuns used to march at night, every evening; all patient rooms had to have their doors shut before this ritual was performed. It is said that the nuns march again before a patient dies.

Norwich	United States	In 1994, a man who lived about ten miles away got in a heated argument with his mother. The man was known to be very ignitable and he stormed out of their house and booked a room at the Siesta Motel. Later that night his mother found out where he was and called him, making him even angrier. A short while after the man went to sleep, he was awaken by the sound of someone in his room. Assuming it was his mother stepping out of bounds, and enraged, he attacked the figure in the dark. When a struggle broke out, the robber accidentally killed the man. The ghost roams over the entire building, slamming doors, turning lights off, whispering vulgarities, a few reports of crying and laughter combined, taking things and putting them in odd places, and people have reported being hit by the dark haired man.

Oxford	United States	"The Adina Indian Mound - This is very easy to get to all you need is a flash light because it does require a bit of walking. This Medina Indian mound is dated back to sometime in the BC’s there is a little plaque before you get to it that tells you the dates so you can find that out if you go check it. you might feel this strong sensation of being held back. Witnesses claim to have taken pictures from the top and had strange glowing figures, and ectomist. Go to the Heuston woods campground. You don't have to pay just go straight thru. its at the end of row b just park on the road. you have to walk through a big field but if you just go straight you'll run smack into it. The Adena Indians were ""Mound Builders"" of prehistoric time date estimating from approximately 1000 B.C.-700 A.D. along with the Hopewell Indians whose appearance is estimated at approximately 400 B.C. The name came from Adena, the Chillicothe, Ohio estate of Thomas Worthington, governor of Ohio from 1814-1818.

There have been sightings mainly in just individual rooms in the dorm. There has been documentation of a girl hanging herself in room 210, and then another person hanging themselves in that same room years later.

Flash your bright lights 3 times, first you should see small flashing red lights, then see the motorcycle headlight coming down the road. The story is there was a guy and a girl whose love was forbidden so they would sneak out to see each other, the girl would take her fathers car and pull out to the end of the road and flash her lights 3 times to signal to her boyfriend to come see her, well one night she signaled him and he began down the road to see her, supposedly a young boy was riding! his bicycle in the road, the guy on the motorcycle didn’t see him until it was too late wrecked into him and they both died, (the red lights are the reflectors off the bicycle) when the girl saw this she hung herself from the barn in her yard (which is the same yard you turn around in) the barn is still there but only remains.

Point Place/Toledo	United States	A haunted rocky shore line. A young female ghost appears almost every night at sundown. She walks across the rocky shoreline barefooted in a bright white evening dress. Legend has it that her love sailed out to the lake at dusk, and she went out to look for him. He never came home. - June 2008 Update: It's a remote section of Reno Beach. To get to it, you have to park in the last lot and walk over a short bridge and go through a path in the wooded areas. On the left side of the path you'll see the refinery, and on the right is a section of rocky ledges that lead down to a flat area about 7X8ft. At times you can see the woman in white, but we've also observed a young boy (about 6 or 7 years old) who tends to follow you on the water though the woods and over the bridge. He seems friendly, and smiles so it's almost like he's trying to play with you. He stops at the waters edge by the bridge though, looking forlorn like he can't pass there.

Portsmouth	United States	830 Murray - It is said that two brothers owned this building, formerly a shoe company. They went bankrupt and the one brother jumped to his death from a window on the fifth floor. Also rumors say it could have been the elevator shaft he jumped down. His brother was so devastated having lost his brother that he, in turn, killed himself. The 2 stories circulating are he threw himself off the roof, or jumped on the tracks in front of a train, which runs right next to the building. It is rumored that you can hear screams on the 5th floor and a breeze blowing, sometimes you might even see or feel the presence of a ghost. They don't have anyone work directly on the fifth floor anymore because people will not stay. One woman working there refuses to go past the third floor. It's definitely a scary place.

If you leave a sponge on the sink in the fudge area and leave to go and do something, like take your break or go outside to get something and you come back and your sponge is gone. No one else has taken it or even seen where it went to. Then when you go back, sometimes the sponge reappears in the same place that you last left and there are only 2 of you in the stand.

Hotel Breakers has now four sections all of which were built at different places in time, the oldest and still central being of the hotel is ""The Rotunda"" which is named so for its circular five floored circular structure of which live it's majority of rooms. ""The Lobby"" is a two story structure in which contain offices and old meeting rooms on the first floor of such, second floor has rooms that were once guest rooms, now employee dwellings. this is that which we are most interested in for in one of the two second floor hallways is room #169. The very room in which during the early 1900's when the park was still just a beach resort, a guest by the name of Mary hung herself in dismay (supposed to that of a lover), hung herself in her room. Since then, Employee and guest alike have had odd occurrences, disturbances, violent unseen actions, noises, problems with electronics occur. The third oldest portion of the hotel ""Breakers East"" Which in itself wasn't built until the mid 90's and is portioned into three and four floors. The occurrences in this section were sightings of ""Faceless apparitions"" in a small combination of number. All other sightings and instances are not known as re-occurring and random. The whole park is rumored to be haunted, and also rumored to have been built on a native burial ground."

Sandusky	United States	In the 1800's, the McGreen was given money as a gift. they argued among each other what they should do with it. They left the money in their wagon until the morning so they would have time to decide. When the family awoke, the money was gone. Mr. McGreen was so mad that he killed everyone and hung himself in the well. Strange things happened in the house for almost 200 years later. Doors would open by themselves. Pets refused to go into the dining room nor would plants ever live in it. Small fires would start in the fireplace on their own. Door handles would be witnessed as wiggled when no one was on the other side to do so. Shadows are seen and images are seen outside a huge picture window that looks over a river. the well is still there and nothing will grow with in a 10 feet radius of it. In 1979, the house mysteriously burned down without any indication of a cause.

Sandusky	United States	When employees walk the halls of the third floor at night, there is an uncanny feeling that they are not alone. The television in 317 will turn on and flip channels all by itself. A laundry attendant was trapped in 315 (the locks are on the inside, and the door opens to the inside, but the door would not open from the inside.) Housekeepers cleaning room 324 have seen the curtains in 312 fluttering/opening, but when the room was checked, the AC unit was off and the room was vacant. Doors slamming and footsteps can be heard when employees are up there alone, but when they call out or go to see who's there, the halls are empty.

Shadyside	United States	Several students setting up for a haunted house sponsored by the band were, making a spoof of the Blair Witch project around 1am right before Halloween. On the film there were blue orbs and you could hear lockers shutting and people talking. None of these things were happening at the time. There was also a new night janitor who was changing a fuse on the 3rd floor. She guessed as to which one it was, when she went to pull out the fuse a hand touched her on the shoulder and told her that it is the one next to her.

Springied	United States	The Stage in the auditorium is haunted by the ghosts of two children, a boy, and a girl. Before the school was built there, it was a graveyard to the children's home across the field. All of the graves were moved to not to far away, to accommodate the school, but somehow, two tombstones were lost, maybe even the graves themselves.

Stark county	United States	Fairmount Children's Home - On Route 183 heading towards Minerva, behind the Fairmount Greenhouse is an old beat down Orphanage. 3 stories off the ground and with a humongous basement that has tunnels leading all over. Going inside the house you will frequently hear voices, footsteps, see people outside while you are inside, feelings of being watched, and see shadows on walls. You just get an overall creepy feeling just by looking at the place.

Trenton	United States	There is an old cemetery on Wehr Road that is said to be haunted. Many people have driven down it at night, as it is very popular to younger kids. Once you approach the cemetery, a man, dressed in old dirty clothes will chase you away. He is said to be the old caretaker of the cemetery who was killed by a maniac with a hatchet. He now carries the hatchet and, on some nights, if you drive by you can hear the hatchet hitting a metal door on the side of the mausoleum. There are several hatchet marks on this door.

Troy	United States	The entrance to the cemetery is surrounded by nothing but woods and the entrance is barely wide enough for a car. After you drive or walk up two smaller hills, the cemetery is on the left. The latest burial in here is from the 1800's. There is one lonely tree in the middle. At night, you can hear footsteps all around you in the woods, footsteps, which sound like walking on concrete, in the top of the tree and what appears to be the shrieking of a woman who is often heard after an Owl. On some nights you can hear moaning from the far back left corner of the cemetery. Rumor is, a woman in the 1870's was raped and murdered here while visiting her grandfather’s grave.

Troy	United States	This old country road is the sight where a motorcycle accident occurred years ago. A man not wearing a helmet was killed when he veered off the road and hit a tree. On the same road about mile down there is an old roped off trail where KKK members supposedly had meetings and sometimes hangings. Driving the road at night you can sometimes see a small green glowing orb off to the side of the road in the trees.

Urbana/West Liberty	United States	Supposedly, there was a man who was building a house for his wife and children, while it was being built the wife and children died in a horrible accident, (a train hit them) and though grief stricken, the husband completed the house. the husband was so distraught, that he set fire to the house then hung himself from the giant oak in front of the house. (it is said that sometimes there is a noose still hanging there)Though the entire house was set ablaze, only the back wall fell completely burnt, the rest of the house is intact, and many strange occurrences are said to happen there. the mystery of this haunting is that, no one is allowed to approach it at all. If you are seen going anywhere near it, you will be arrested. the old tree is still there, off of Clark road, dead, but still standing with the limb he hung himself on jutting out into the road.

Vermilion	United States	There's an angel above a grave, that is haunted. Legend goes...mother killed her daughter, and then died a few years later, after the family had put angel by daughter's grave. It is said that angry spirit of mother resides in angel. Sometime after mother died, local livestock began to show up mysteriously slaughtered in cruel, sadistic manner. Blood was found on hands and mouth of angel, prompting locals to suspect the mother had possessed the angel, and was doing the vile deeds. Local officials took matters into their own hands, clipping the wings of the angels and cutting off the hands. After this, the angel was forced to remain within the cemetery, flightless and without ability to kill. Soon after, rusty streak marks developed under the angel's eyes, as though she was crying for her sins.

The graveyard is dated and worn with only few tombstones behind it with only but thirty at most stones contained. The supposed story follows that a weary and distraught wife of a civil war officer (of himself had been killed in battle) threw herself to the river of what once drew deeper than it's current form. She is seen also annually during winter months thou in flowing white gown or white soaked in blood and haggard and drenched either matter crying can be heard sometimes.

Warren	United States	"The Underground Railroad"" - All too many homes in the area that still stand from that time all have secret passages, hidden doors and any trick the Railroaders could think to build. One in specific of these devices was a tunnel that led right beneath the Mahoning River itself not but two hundred yards from the Courthouse, of which is still standing in it's own eloquence. this tunnel was of about the length of a football field and is not visible form but five feet from either entrance, and now has been fortified off for danger of collapse. Apparently that is what brought about such as is a haunting. during time of escaping slaves, the tunnel had once collapsed. the river only being one third as wide as the tunnel was long still waved threat. a collapse toward an end trapped a group of slaves who moans and screams could be heard for days. The screams can still be heard on cool autumn days."

West Chester	United States	"Screaming Bridge -  The Screaming Bridge is located on Maud-Hughes Road in Liberty Twp. The Bridge is about 25ft above the Railroad tracks and was part of the old line C.C.C. and St. Louis back in the late 1800's and at the turn of the century it became New York Central Freight around 1900. On Sunday morning Oct 24th 1909 an Freight Train was traveling northbound from Union Twp ""which is to the south"" when 2 engineers where scalded to death when the steam train boiler blew. They say to this day reports of the dead trainmen in black walk the tracks between the Screaming Bridge to Gano. The bridge is a common place for car accidents as well as suicides over the years. To this day at least 36 reported people have lost their lives on or near the bridge. Ghostly figures are commonly seen on film with 110 400 speed or 35mm b/w or color 400 speed film. Other ghostly lights and spirit energy are commonly reported on film too. The rarely seen Invisible Bridge and train may be also captured on film too. Other things not as commonly are ghostly fogs appearing on the tracks below ""even that you seen no fog on the tracks as you took the pic"" Black hooded figures are also seen. Another story is that a bus driver lost control of the bus and all the children in it died. If you are coming up the road, there is a sign that says ""school bus stop ahead."" And if you drive across the bridge, it sounds like children are screaming. Another is there was a murder near that bridge also. And if you park on the bridge, turn your car off, roll your windows down and flash your lights three times, you will see a man with an axe walking toward your car. And yet another is of a woman threw her baby off the bridge and hung herself afterwards. People go there in the middle of the night and say they hear screams."

Willoughby Hills	United States	In early 1800's, Mr. Squire was to build a castle for his wife in the country. When the gatehouse was finished, he took his wife to stay the night so she could see how life in the country was. She awoke in the middle of the night to sounds of wild animals and wandered the house, terrified. She tripped down the basement stairs and was hung on a rope from the raptors. The basement was sealed up and construction was ended. Apparently Mr. Squires was so upset over the shock of his wife's death that he never removed her body from the basement. When at the castle at night, you can hear Mrs. Squires screaming and roaming from room to room. You can also see her dimly in the room the basement used to lead off from.

Wooster	United States	"The fine dining area of the restaurant, in this former Wayne County Jail in Wooster, used to actually be the cell block. The area is located in the basement of the building. The restaurant is said to be haunted by a man who was the first, and only, person to be hung in Wayne County. He was locked up in a cell on the basement floor, but was hung on the third floor. His actions are noticed most late in the evening and early morning hours. Several restaurant managers have made comments about calls being made to the tavern (a separate building that was once used as the jail garage - now used as ""The Olde Jaol Tavern"") from the fine dining phone when there is no-one in the fine dining area.

Zaleski	United States	Near the Zaleski CCC Camp is an old railway tunnel named Moonville Tunnel. The tunnel is still there and many local kids swim there in the creek. In the 1800's during a thunderstorm the trestle or train bridge was washed out. With no other way to stop the train the signalman stood this side of the creek where the trestle had stood. On the opposite bank was just about 20 feet then the tunnel itself. On the other side of the tunnel was a turn in the track. It was near midnight so the story goes when the signalman was waving the lantern to warn of danger. He knew it was of little use because of the layout of the track and tunnel before the trestle. The train probably didn't even see his light before crashing into the ravine below. A lot of people died that night in the crash. People who live down in the area swear that they've been to the tunnel on the anniversary of the tragic disaster. They swear that you can clearly see the signalman lamp swinging it's warning and you can see the light of the oncoming train.

Bernardsville	United States	Devil's Tree - Turn onto Long Rd, (which is really short) then make a left at the end, you will come upon a highly wooded area and then it just opens up into a field. At the end of the field there is a huge hideous looking tree with a branch that extends perfectly parallel to the ground. It is said that the tree was used to hang slaves on and still has a chilling aura to it. You can see marks on the trunk from people attempting to chop it down, they say whoever tries, something bad happens to and sometimes a pickup truck will try to chase you out. In the Summer that tree is in full bloom and actually quite lovely. In the Winter or Fall however, it is creepy looking. The axe marks on the tree are from years of kids hearing the legend of the tree and what would happen if you tried to cut it down. Supposedly if you try to cut it down the devil in a black pick up truck will come and chase you away, once you drive down the road a bit the truck just vanishes. It's an Urban Legend that gets featured in Weird NJ magazine all the time. Please get permission before you visit this property, otherwise you are trespassing and could get arrested.

Cape May	United States	(formerly known as Maureen's & New International Cuisine) - this Italian restaurant harbors the ghost of a baby girl, who the owners have named Gloria. It is believed that either murder was involved or the baby girl died while in her crib. Most of the haunting activity occurs in the cupola and upper floors of this restaurant. Customers & employees have felt her presence and have heard the rustling of furniture in the upper floors. An old black-and-white photography taken about 1900, located near the entrance in the downstairs lounge, shows the ghostly image of the baby girl Gloria. What is shocking about this picture is that the baby appears to be trapped in an old column! The picture was enlarged and examined by expers and the owners and have determined that there's no way a baby could stand in that position.

Chester	United States	A farmhouse dating back to the mid-1800s, now refurbished and occupied by ClinCon Research. Haunted by young girl in a white dress. A 19-century farmer living in the house often saw the girl staring at him, and sometimes crying, through a window. His dog refused to go in the room where the girl most often appeared. Finally he locked his dog in the room, and the dog chewed and clawed his way almost all the way through the door to get out.

Lambertville	United States	"The school was built in 1854. A fire destroyed much of it in 1926, but was remodeled in 1927. According to rumor, there was another fire in 1992 which destroyed the school for good. An ""official"" closing date has not yet been found. Several have claimed that in one of the classrooms on the second floor, the black boards were covered with drawings of children crying and burning. Another local legend is that of ""Buckeye"". There are actually two versions of this story, but with the same basic back-story. There was a championship football game between Lambertville and New Hope (PA). An intense game was going on. During a normal play, one of the New Hope Buckeyes was tackled to the ground. When all the players got up, this boy was left lying still on the grass. Because of this tragedy, the parents of the New Hope students had football removed form the schools extra-curricular activities. Urban legend #1- You are to stand on the landing between the first and second floors, just inside the front doors, and say out loud ""I challenge Billy (or Buckeye, depending on who you ask) to a football game!"" Then, out of nowhere, a football is supposed to fly straight at your head, breaking your neck. Urban Legend #2- While on the football field, located somewhere further up the hill, one is supposed to say out loud ""Buckeye, I challenge you to a race!"" A wind blows in, then either a mist arises or a pair of glowing, red eyes appear at one end of the field. A voice is heard saying, ""Run to the other end of the field or die!"" It was rebuilt then abandoned in the 1950's due to zoning issues. Kids are known to commit suicide from the third story gym windows. Reports of free floating apparitions, cold spots, and sounds heard by the EVPs. Also documented in pictures taken were ectoplasm like clouds and apparitions in 3rd floor window. Also strange noises when quiet. Plans to tear this building down in the very near future.WARNING: if you go there do not park on Washington street, you can get arrested for trespassing."

Lavallette	United States	Eighty years ago, a middle aged sea captain purchased a large house on the boardwalk facing the ocean. Legend states that he bought it for his young wife, who was only eighteen at the time. A few years later, the Captain made his final voyage, never to return. His young wife was said to have spent countless nights on the widows walk, waiting for the Captain to return. One frigid January morning, exactly two years after the Captain left, her body was found frozen on the widows walk. To this day she can be seen standing on the widows walk, waiting for her beloved to return.

Madison	United States	Great Hall - There are a lot of haunted places at Drew University, actually.  The Great Hall is a castle-like structure in the middle of campus where the teachers have their offices.  The upper floor is a long, red-carpeted room where religious services used to be held.  The room is wood paneled with carvings along the beams, a large fireplace, and paneled doors, which blend into the wall.  People have reported seeing faces in the ceiling carvings, the chandeliers swing sometimes for no reason, and people have also reported strange reflections of a man with round, gold spectacles in a mirror there.  Feelings of being pushed to leave have also been reported.

Madison	United States	"The Arboretum - The arboretum is said to be haunted by the ""lady in blue"" who appears near a lake in the back of the woods and trips people, appears during sunset most often, but also during the day, which is kind of unusual.  She appears filmy and no one has ever seen a face or body, just a bluish dress.  The girl who haunts Hoyt, which was an all boys dormitory back in the day, was supposed to have slept with one of the boys, discovered she was pregnant, and hung herself in the attic.  It is definitely true that the top floor has lots of weird things happening.  Witnesses have seen doors open, window shades fly up.  It is generally held that boys do not fair well on the top floor - it's been an all girls floor for quite a while. They tend to fall for no reason and break something.  A part of the underground railroad stretches underneath the campus all the way to the next town."

New Monmauth	United States	During the Revolutionary War the woods that once stood where now stands a housing sub-division, with the street name of Shelly Drive, provided cover and refuge to many troops of both sides of the American conflict. It has long been said that where the street Shelly Drive ends into a new sub-division there was a horrible battle between Patriots and British troops. So Bloody and horrific was this Battle that scores of troops from both sides were killed. One particularly poor soul was that of a boy named William Champlain who fought on the side of the Patriots but was a spy for the British. When it was discovered by Washington's troops that Champlain was a spy they did not let on to him that he was compromised. At the start of the battle it was relayed to the troops by Washington himself that Champlain should be shot from behind to let the British know that his traitorous dealings didn't deserve a bullet from the firing squad. Upon the start of the Battle Champlain moved to the front of the line to get a better shot he was heard to say, and before the first volley of shots were exchanged between side's he was dropped in his stride from a volley of shot's from five patriot's. It has long been said that the spirit of William Champlain Haunt's the sub-division in search of Washington in the hopes of finding out why he was struck down by his own troops. Being only a boy of 17 at the time of his demise and fond of the flute he has been heard many a fall night playing sad ballads and tunes in search of his mentor. So if you are walking or driving down Shelly Drive one evening and see a young lad dressed in Colonial attire don't be alarmed it is only William Champlain looking for his troops bivouac, and the reason for his betrayal.

Oak Valley	United States	"Hermit House - At the ""Dead End"" woods where Stanford and Hamilton meet, there once stood a cabin in the woods inhabited by an old white-bearded hermit. The cabin was along a wooded pathway near a small bridge backing the houses along Montclair.

Pennington	United States	Just pulling into the stone-covered parking lot on the side of the house one begins to feel a sense of foreboding. Once in the house, a sense of negative energy can be felt. Spend time in the house and you will see and sense things. Dogs and cats will run from or refuse to enter certain rooms at different times. Heavily lined drapes will blow on a windless day with the windows shut like they were fine linen on a windy day. Heavy person-less footsteps on the wooden stairs can be heard. Door-knobs will turn violently. Faint voices and moving objects and opening and closing doors on their own. Knocks on bedroom doors late at night when no one is there if you open the door. A sense of relief can be felt when pulling away from the house.

Quinton/Bridgeton	United States	The true story of Berry’s' Chapel is, Berry was a black pastor hung by the KKK. The chapel was built back in the Civil war days. It burned down in the early sixties. The grave yard was starting to get desecrated from local kids parting in the area, and skulls started appearing in trees by the main party spot.. It was then the county moved all the bodies to the graveyard surrounding the ancient oak tree near the Salem City public library. The area is blocked off now and you can't drive back there. The Chapel was just in the paper again this week (05-27-02) as they were again cleaning up the area from those lame people who feel they have to dump all their trash back there. What was always odd is how nothing would ever grow on Berry’s' grave. No grass, no weeds, no bushes, nothing.

To this date no one was charged with the abduction and murder of Johnpat.

Washington	United States	This cemetery is kind of large and extends on both sides of a small street off RT. 57 in Washington. In the smaller side of the cemetery there are 3 large headstones (possible the largest in that section). It was a husband, a wife and child, and a family friend. They were all murdered together in the family's house in the 1840's. If you read the epitaph on the headstones it mentions something about the wrath of God coming down upon those who did the murders. (the words are very warn and hard to read). This event was known as the Changewater Murders. Apparently the wrong people were caught and hung for the crime and by the time authorities figured out who really committed the murders, they were long gone. Orbs have been seen and caught on film.

District of Columbia	United States	Building 21 - This is the building where John Wilkes Booth was hung (even though he was already dead). He was hung in the attic of the building. he wasn't the only person to be hanged there. One of the companies carrying out renovations to this old building report: All of the tradesmen on the job start very early in the morning (when it's still dark outside). The carpenters there have reported hearing footsteps in the attic and they have had something follow very close behind him up the cellar stairs, close enough to him to cause him to RUN the rest of the stairs to the first floor. They were also working in two of the three rooms in the attic when they noticed what looked like a fly flying around in all three rooms. The only thing is that there were no flys in any of the rooms (the rooms are small and wide open, so a fly could not hide from site).

District of Columbia	United States	Adams Hotel - This hotel was built in 1927 on the site of the mansion of Presidential Advisor Henry Adams in the 1880's. The wife of the original mansion owner, Marian Hooper Adams, was found dead in front of the fireplace, either by illness, murder or suicide. Throughout the hotel her spirit has been seen or felt. At night, the scent of Mimosa is in the air on the eighth floor and the housekeeping closet on the 6th floor will NEVER stay locked after repeated lockings with the key by security. One reported incident by the hotel's security chief in 1997 showed that all the guest room doors opened at the same time on the 2nd floor. Marion Adams is buried in Rock Creek Cemetery with her grave covered by a large statue (by sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens) of a hooded woman. If you stand in front of this statue and look upon it, you will begin to cry. This statue has been called GRIEF. You will also notice that the chandelier of the hotel's lobby constantly sways.
